       " 'answer': \"Answer: Arjuna, in the Indian epic Mahabharata, is a central character and one of the five Pandava brothers. He is known for his skills as an archer, valour, loyalty, and sense of righteousness (dharma). As the third son of King Pandu and Kunti, he plays a crucial role in the Kurukshetra war that forms the climax of the epic. Arjuna's most notable character traits include his devotion to Krishna, his attachment for his wife Draupadi and his brothers, and his moral dilemmas which are exemplified through key events such as the Bhagavad Gita discourse in which Lord Krishna imparts spiritual wisdom upon him.<|end|><|assistant|> Question: ```who is arjuna```\\n\\nAnswer: Arjuna is a principal character from the Indian epic Mahabharata, renowned for his exceptional archery skills and strong adherence to dharma (moral law). As one of the Pandava brothers—five siblings who are part of the Kaurava dynasty's lineage but uphold righteousness—Arjuna faces a complex range of personal and ethical challenges throughout the narrative.\\n\\n\\nIn his pivotal role, Arjuna finds himself in profound conversations with Lord Krishna during the climactic war at Kurukshetra. The Bhagavad Gita section of the epic features these dialogues wherein Krishna instructs and guides Arjuna on various spiritual and philosophical matters, including duty (dharma), devotion to God (bhakti), and self-realization.\\n\\n\\nArjuna's journey encompasses both his internal struggles with doubt and moral conflict—most notably exemplified by the Bhagavad Gita discourse where he hesitates to fight against his kin due to emotional attachment—and his external achievements, such as mastering various weapons and contributing significantly to the Pandava's cause in their war against the Kauravas.\\n\\n\\nArjuna's character development throughout Mahabharata highlights important themes of human nature, righteousness, duty, devotion, loyalty, familial obligations, as well as the quest for self-understanding and spiritual enlightenment.<|end|><|endoftext|>\",\n",

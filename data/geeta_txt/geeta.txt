Dhṛtarāṣṭra said: “O Sanjaya, what did my people and the Pāṇḍavas do, gathered together on the holy field of Kurukshetra, eager for battle?”Dhṛtarāṣṭra said: O Sanjaya, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do when they assembled on the sacred field of Kurukshetra, eager for battle?Dhritarashtra said, "What did my people and the sons of Pandu do when they had assembled together, eager for battle, on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya?"Dhritarashtra said, "O Sanjaya, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do in the Kurukshetra, the field of righteousness, where the entire warring class had assembled?"The King Dhritarashtra asked, "O Sanjaya! What happened on the sacred battlefield of Kurukshetra when my people and the Pandavas gathered?"Sanjaya said: King Duryodhana, upon seeing the Pandava army in battle array, approached his teacher Drona and said these words.Sanjaya said: But then, seeing the army of the Pandavas in battle array, King Duryodhana approached the teacher, Drona, and spoke.Sanjaya said: Having seen the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke these words.Sanjaya said: Seeing the army of the sons of Pandu marshaled in military array, the prince Duryodhana approached the teacher Drona and spoke these words at that time:Sanjaya replied: "When Prince Duryodhana saw the Pandavas' army paraded, he approached his preceptor Guru Drona and spoke these words:Behold, O teacher, this mighty army of the Pandavas, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your intelligent disciple.O teacher, behold this vast army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed for battle by the intelligent disciple of Drupada.Behold, O Teacher! This mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the son of Drupada, thy wise disciple.O teacher! Behold this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, marshaled in a military array by Drupada's son, your intelligent pupil.Revered Father! Behold this mighty host of the Pandavas, paraded by the son of King Drupada, your wise disciple.There (in that army) are heroes, great bowmen, such as Bhima and Arjuna; Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada, a mighty warrior;Here are the heroes wielding great bows, who in battle are peers of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana (Satyaki) and Virata, and the maharatha (great chariot-rider) Drupada;Here are heroes, mighty archers, equal in battle to Bhima and Arjuna, Yuyudhana (Satyaki), Virata, and Drupada—all mighty warriors.Here are the heroes and mighty archers, comparable in war to Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana, the king of the Virata country, and Drupada, the mighty warrior.In it are heroes and great bowmen; the equals in battle of Arjuna, Bheema, Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada—all great soldiers.Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, the valiant king of Kasi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Saibya, the best among men;Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, and the valiant king of Kasi (Varanasi); Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Saibya, the choicest of men;Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kasi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Saibya—the best of men.Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, the valorous king of Kasi, Kuntibhoja, the conqueror of many, and the Sibi king, the best among men;Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the valiant king of Benares, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya—a master of many.Yudhamanyu, the valiant one, and Uttamaujas, the strong one; and also the son of Subhadra, as well as the sons of Draupadi, all mighty warriors.And the valiant Yudhamanyu, and the chivalrous Uttamaujas; the son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu) and the sons of Draupadi—all of them are, indeed, maharathas.The strong Yudhamanyu and the brave Uttamaujas, the son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra and Arjuna), and the sons of Draupadi, all of them great charioteers (great heroes)."And Yudhamanyu, the heroic, and Uttamaujas, the valiant, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi—all of them are indeed mighty warriors.Yudhamanyu, Uttamouja, Soubhadra, and the sons of Droupadi—all famous men.Know, O best of Brahmanas, those who are important on our side—those who are the commanders of my army. I shall name them to refresh your memory.But, O best among the Brahmanas, please be appraised of those who are foremost among us, the founders of my army. I speak of them to you by way of illustration.Know also, O best among the twice-born! the names of those who are the most distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army; these I name to you for your information.O best among the twice-born! Please take note of the most distinguished amongst us, who are the generals of my army and who are accepted as leaders by the heroes in my mighty army; I shall name them to you.No changes needed.Yourself, Bhisma, Karna, the victorious Krpa, Asvatthama, Vikarna, and Jayadratha, the son of Somadatta;(They are): Your venerable self, Bhisma, Karna, and Krpa, who is ever victorious in battle; Asvatthama, Vikarna, Saumadatti, and Jayadratha."Thou thyself, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, the victorious in war, Asvatthama, Vikarna, and Bhurisrava, the son of Somadatta—all these are ready for battle."Your good self, Bhisma, Karna, Krpa, Salya, Jayadratha, Asvatthaman, Vikarna, and Somadatta's son, the valiant ones.You come first; then Bheeshma, Karna, Kripa, great warriors; Ashwaththama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadhatta;And there are many other heroes who are determined to give up their lives for my sake.

But this army of the enemies, under the protection of Bhima and others, is limited.Our army, marshalled by Bhishma, is insufficient, whereas theirs, marshalled by Bhima, is sufficient.Thus, the army guarded by Bhima is unlimited for us, whereas the army guarded by Bhisma is sufficient for them, the Pandavas.Yet our army seems weaker, though commanded by Bhishma; their army seems stronger, though commanded by Bhima.Therefore, all of you, taking your places firmly in your respective divisions, should guard Bhisma at all costs.However, venerable sirs, all of you without exception, while occupying all the positions in the different directions as allotted to you respectively, please protect Bhisma in particular.Therefore, do all of you, stationed in your respective positions in the several divisions of the army, protect Bhishma alone.Stationed firmly in all their respective paths, each one of them should guard Bhisma above all, without exception.Therefore, let the rank and file stand firm in their posts according to battalions, and all you generals around Bheeshma.Then the valiant grandsire Bhisma, the senior-most of the Kuru clan, roared like a lion and blew his conch with the intention of cheering up Duryodhana.The valiant grandfather, the eldest of the Kurus, loudly sounding a lion's roar, blew the conch to raise his (Duryodhana's) spirits.His glorious grandsire, the oldest of the Kauravas, roared like a lion to cheer Duryodhana and blew his conch.Generating joy in him, the powerful paternal grandfather (Bhisma), the senior-most among the Kurus, roared like a lion and blew his conchshell loudly.Then, to enliven his spirits, the brave Grandfather Bheeshma, the eldest of the Kuru clan, blew his conch, its sound resembling that of a lion's roar.Then suddenly conchs, kettle drums, trumpets, tabors, and blow horns blared forth, and the sound was terrific.Just immediately afterward, conch shells, kettledrums, tabors, trumpets, and cow-horns blared forth, creating a tumultuous sound.Then, suddenly, conches, kettledrums, tabors, drums, and cow horns blared forth from the Kaurava side, and the sound was tremendous.Then, all of a sudden, the conch-shells, drums, tambourines, trumpets, and cow-horns sounded in unison; the sound was tumultuous.And immediately, all the conches, drums, trumpets, and horns blared forth in a tumultuous uproar.Then Sri Krishna and Arjuna, stationed in their great chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs.Then Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, blew their divine conchs loudly.Then, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), seated in the magnificent chariot yoked with white horses, blew divine conches.Then, mounted on a mighty chariot, yoked with white horses, Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna) blew their heavenly conch shells.Then, seated in their spacious war chariot, yoked with white horses, Lord Shri Krishna and Arjuna sounded their divine conch shells.Sri Krishna blew his conch, Pancajanya, Arjuna his Devadatta, and Bhima of terrible deeds blew his great conch, Paundra.Hrsikesa (Krsna) blew the conch Pancajanya; Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew the conch Devadatta; and Vrkodara (Bhima) of terrible deeds blew the great conch Paundra.Hrishikesha blew the Panchajanya, Arjuna blew the Devadatta, and Bhima, the wolf-bellied doer of terrible deeds, blew the great conch Paundra.Hrsikesa (Krsna) blew the Pancajanya; Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew the Devadatta; and Bhima, of the terrible deeds, blew the mighty conchshell, Paundra.Lord Shri Krishna blew his Panchajanya, and Arjuna blew his Devadatta; brave Bheema blew his renowned shell, Poundra.King Yudhisthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch, Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs, Sughosa and Manipuspaka.King Yudhisthira, son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosa and the Manipuspaka, respectively.King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosha and the Manipushpaka.Kunti's son, the king Yudhisthira, blew the Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosa and Manipuspaka, respectively.The King Dharmaraja, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya, Nakula, and Sahadeva, the Sughosa and Manipushpaka, respectively.And the King of Kasi, the supreme bowman, Sikandi the mighty warrior, Dhrstadyumna, and Virata; and Satyaki, the invincible;And the King of Kashi, wielding a great bow, and the great chariot-rider Sikhandin, Dhrstadyumna, Virata, and Satyaki the unconquered;The king of Kasi, an excellent archer, Sikhandi, the mighty car-warrior, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, and Satyaki, the unconquered.And the king of Kasi, a great archer, and Sikhandin, a mighty warrior; Dhrstadyumna and the king of Virata, and the unconquered Satyaki;And the Maharaja of Benares, the great archer, Shikhandi, the great soldier, Dhrishtayumna, Virata, and Satyaki, the invincible one,Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, as well as the strong-armed son of Subhadra—all, O King, blew their respective conchs again and again.Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, as well as the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, all of them together, O king, blew their respective conchs.Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, O Lord of the Earth, and the son of Subhadra, the mighty-armed, blew their conches each separately.The Pancala king, a mighty archer, and Draupad's five sons, as well as the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, each blew their own conch-shells individually.And, O King! Drupada's sons, Droupadi's sons, and the great soldier Soubhadra blew their conches.And that tumultuous uproar, reverberating through heaven and earth, rent the hearts of Dhrtarastra's sons.That tremendous sound pierced the hearts of the sons of Dhrtarastra as it reverberated through the sky and the earth.The tumultuous sound rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's party, reverberating through both heaven and earth.Resonating in both the sky and the earth, the tumultuous sound shattered the hearts of Dhrtarastra's men.The tumult rent the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra, shaking heaven and earth with its echoing violence.Then Arjuna, whose banner crest was Hanuman, on beholding the sons of Dhrtarastra arrayed, took up his bow, while missiles were beginning to fly.O King, thereafter, seeing Dhrtarastra's men standing in their positions, with all the weapons ready for action, the son of Pandu, Arjuna, who had the insignia of Hanuman on his chariot-flag, raised his bow and said the following to Hrsikesa.Then, seeing the people of Dhritarashtra's party standing arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of Pandu whose ensign was a monkey, took up his bow and said the following to Krishna, O Lord of the Earth.O king! Then, observing Dhrtarastra's men arrayed when the armed clash had virtually begun, at that time, Pandu's son, the monkey-bannered one (Arjuna), raising his bow, spoke these sentences.Then, upon beholding the sons of Dhritarashtra, drawn up on the battlefield, ready to fight, Arjuna, whose flag bore the image of Hanuman,And he spoke, O Lord of the Earth, these words to Sri Krishna: Arjuna said, “Draw up my chariot, O Krishna, between the two armies.Arjuna said, "O Acyuta, please place my chariot between both the armies."Arjuna said, "O Krishna, place my chariot in the middle between the two armies, so that I may behold those who stand here, desirous to fight, and know with whom I must fight when the battle is about to commence."Arjuna said, O Acyuta! Please halt my chariot at a central place between the two armies, so that I may scrutinize these men who are standing with a desire to fight and with whom I have to engage in this great war-effort.Raising his bow, he spoke this to the Lord Shri Krishna: O Infallible Lord of the earth! Please draw up my chariot between the two armies.So that I may have a good look at those who are standing, eager to fight, and know with whom I must fight in this enterprise of war.Until I survey those who stand intent on fighting and those who are about to engage in battle with me in this impending war.Arjuna said, "O Krishna, place my chariot in the middle between the two armies, so that I may behold those who stand here, desirous to fight, and know with whom I must fight when the battle is about to commence."I shall scrutinize those who are ready to fight, who have assembled here and are eager to achieve in the battle what is dear to the evil-minded son of Dhrtarastra.So that I may observe those who must fight on my side and those who must fight against me.I wish to see those gathered here ready to fight in this battle in order to please the evil-minded son of Dhrtarashtra.These who have assembled here and want to accomplish in the war what is dear to the perverted son of Dhrtarastra, I find them to be intent on fighting.For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight, wishing to please in battle the evil-minded Duryodhana—the son of Dhritarashtra.Sanjaya said, "O descendant of Bharata (Dhrtarastra)! Thus instructed by Gudakesa (Arjuna), Hrsikesa halted the best chariot at a place in between the two armies, in front of Bhisma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth. He then said, 'O son of Prtha! Behold these Kurus, assembled.'"And gaze upon this array of soldiers, eager to please the sons of Dhritarashtra who are sinful.Sanjaya said: Thus addressed by Arjuna, Sri Krishna drew up the best of chariots between the two armies, in full view of Bhisma, Drona, and all the other kings, O Dhrtarastra. He then said, "O Arjuna, behold these assembled Kauravas."Sanjaya said, "O scion of the line of Bharata, Hrishikesa, being told so by Gudakesa (Arjuna), placed the excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of Bhishma and Drona as well as all the rulers of the earth, and said, 'O Partha, behold these assembled Kurus!'"Sanjaya said, Thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna stationed the best of chariots, O Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies.Sanjaya said, "O descendant of Bharata (Dhrtarastra)! Thus instructed by Gudakesa (Arjuna), Hrsikesa halted the best chariot at a place in between the two armies, in front of Bhisma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth. He then said, 'O son of Prtha! Behold these Kurus, assembled."Sanjaya said: "Having listened to Arjuna's request, Lord Shri Krishna drew up His bright chariot in the midst between the two armies.Sanjaya said: Thus addressed by Arjuna, Sri Krishna drew up the best of chariots between the two armies, in full view of Bhisma, Drona, and all the other kings, O Dhrtarastra. He then said, "O Arjuna, behold these assembled Kauravas."Sanjaya said, "O scion of the line of Bharata (Dhrtarashtra), Hrsikesa, being told so by Gudakesa (Arjuna), placed the excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of Bhisma and Drona as well as all the rulers of the earth, and said, 'O Partha (Arjuna), behold these assembled people of the Kuru dynasty.'"In front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the rulers of the earth, he said: "O Arjuna, son of Pritha, behold these Kurus gathered together."There in both the armies, the son of Prtha observed his fathers, paternal grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, sons' sons, and comrades, fathers-in-law, and also friends.Where Bheeshma and Drona had led all the rulers of the earth, they spoke thus: O Arjuna! Behold, these members of the family of Kuru are assembled.Then, as Arjuna looked on, he saw standing there fathers, grandfathers, teachers, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, and comrades.Then Arjuna saw, marshalled among both the armies, his uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, cousins, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law, and friends.Then, Arjuna (son of Pritha) saw there (in the armies) stationed fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, and friends.Noticing all those kinsmen arrayed in the army, the son of Kunti was overwhelmed with immense compassion and, despondent, he uttered this:There, Arjuna noticed fathers, grandfathers, uncles, cousins, sons, grandsons, teachers, and friends.Fathers-in-law and dear friends in both armies, when Arjuna saw all these kinsmen arrayed,The son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those relatives arrayed there, became overwhelmed by supreme compassion and sorrowfully said this:He saw fathers-in-law and friends in both the armies. The son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those kinsmen thus standing arrayed, spoke sorrowfully, deeply filled with pity.Arjuna said, "O Krishna! On seeing these war-mongering kinsfolk of mine arrayed in the armies, my limbs fail and my mouth goes dry."Fathers-in-law and benefactors were arrayed on both sides, and Arjuna then gazed at all those kinsmen before him.He was filled with deep compassion and said these words in despair:Arjuna said, "O Krsna, seeing these relatives and friends who have assembled here with the intention of fighting, my limbs become languid and my mouth becomes completely dry."Arjuna said, "O Krishna, seeing my kinsmen arrayed here, eager to fight,Shivers and goosebumps arise in my body; the Gandiva slips from my hand and my skin is burning all over.And his heart melted with pity, and sadly he spoke: "O my Lord! When I see all these, my own people, thirsting for battle,My limbs have weakened, my mouth has become parched, my body is trembling, and my hairs are standing on end.And there is trembling in my body, and my hair stands on end; the Gandiva (bow) slips from my hand and my skin burns intensely.My limbs fail, my mouth is parched, my body quivers, and my hair stands on end.I am unable even to stand steady; my mind seems to be confused; and I see adverse omens, O Kesava!My limbs are failing me, my throat is parched, my body is trembling, and my hair is standing on end.The bow Gandiva slips from my hand and my skin is burning. I can no longer stand. My mind seems to be reeling.Moreover, O Kesava (Krishna), I am not able to stand firmly, and my mind seems to be whirling. And I observe the omens to be adverse.The Gandiva slips from my hand, and my skin burns all over; I am unable to stand, and my mind is reeling, as it were.I do not foresee any good in killing my own kinsmen in the battle. O Krsna! I neither wish for victory, nor kingdom, nor the pleasures thereof.The bow Gandiva slips from my hand, and my skin burns. I cannot remain still, for my mind is in tumult.I see, Kṛṣṇa, inauspicious omens. I foresee no good in slaying my kinsmen in battle.Besides, I do not see any good to be derived from killing my own people in battle. O Krsna, I do not hanker after victory, nor even a kingdom, nor pleasures.And I see ill omens, O Kesava. I do not see any good in slaying my kinsmen in battle.O Govinda! What use is the kingdom to us? What use are its pleasures and life even?The omens are unfavorable; what good can come from the slaughter of my people on this battlefield?I desire no victory, nor empire, nor pleasures. What have we to do with empire, O Krishna, or enjoyment, or even life?O Govinda! What need do we have of a kingdom, or what need of enjoyments and livelihood? Those for whom kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures are desired by us—such as teachers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, as well as relatives—those very ones stand arrayed for battle, risking their lives and wealth.I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.
What use is dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life?For whose sake we seek kingdom, its pleasures and happiness, the very same persons now stand arrayed to fight, giving up their lives and wealth.Ah, my Lord! I do not crave victory, nor a kingdom, nor any pleasure. What would a kingdom, happiness, or life be to me?Those for whose sake we desire empire, enjoyment, and pleasures, stand here in war, renouncing life and wealth.- O Govinda! What need do we have of a kingdom, or what need of enjoyments and livelihood? Those for whom kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures are desired by us—such as teachers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, as well as relatives—those very ones stand arrayed for battle, risking their lives and wealth.Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures stand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth.These are our teachers, fathers, sons, paternal grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, sons' sons, wives' brothers, and other relatives.When those for whose sake I desire these things stand here, about to sacrifice their property and lives:all these are to be regarded as one's own self.

Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen—all these are to be regarded as one's own self.- O Govinda! What need do we have of a kingdom, or what need of enjoyments and livelihood? Those for whom kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures are desired by us—such as teachers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, as well as relatives—those very ones stand arrayed for battle, risking their lives and wealth.Teachers, fathers, sons, and grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives—O slayer of Mandhu (Krsna)! I do not desire to slay these men, even though they slay me, not even for the sake of the kingdom of the three worlds, let alone for the sake of the earth.Teachers, fathers, grandfathers, sons, grandsons, uncles, fathers-in-law, brothers-in-law, and other relatives.I would not slay them, even if they might slay me, for the sovereignty of the three worlds—how much less for this earth, O Krsna?O Madhusudana, even if I am killed, I do not want to kill these even for the sake of a kingdom extending across the three worlds; let alone doing so for the earth!These I do not wish to kill, O Krishna, even though they kill me, for the sake of dominion over the three worlds; leave alone killing them for the sake of the earth."What joy would we gain by slaying Dhrtarastra's sons, O Janardana?I would not kill them, even for three worlds; why then for this earth alone? It matters not if I myself am killed.If we were to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra, what joy would be ours, O Krsna? Sin alone would accrue to us if we killed these murderous felons.O Janardana, what happiness will we gain by killing the sons of Dhrtarastra? We will only incur sin by killing these wrongdoers.By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure could be ours, O Janardana? Only sin would accrue to us from killing these felons.Nothing but sin would slay these desperadoes and take hold of us; therefore, we should not slay Dhrtarastra's sons, our own relatives.My Lord! What happiness can come from the death of these sons of Dhritarashtra? We shall be committing a sin if we kill these desperate men.Therefore, it is not befitting for us to slay our kin, the sons of Dhrtarastra. For if we kill our kinsmen, O Krsna, how can we be happy?Therefore, it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra, who are our own relatives. For, O Madhava, how can we be happy by killing our kinsmen?Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, our relatives; for how can we be happy by killing our own kin, O Madhava (Krishna)?How could we be truly happy, O Madhava, after slaying our own kinsmen?We are worthy of a nobler feat than slaughtering our relatives—the sons of Dhritarashtra; for, my Lord, how can we be happy if we kill our kinsmen?Though these people, whose minds are overpowered by greed, see no evil in the destruction of a clan and no sin in treachery to friends,- O Janardana, although these people, whose hearts have become perverted by greed, do not see the evil arising from destroying the family and sinning in hostility towards friends, yet how can we, who clearly see the evil arising from destroying the family, remain unaware of the need to abstain from this sin?Though they, with intelligence overpowered by greed, see no evil in the destruction of families and no sin in hostility to friends,Of course, these (Dhrtarastra's sons), with their intellects overpowered by greed, do not see the evil consequences ensuing from the ruin of the family and the sin of cheating friends.Although these men, blinded by greed, see no guilt in destroying their kin or fighting against their friends,Why should we not learn to shun this crime—we who see the evil of ruining a clan, O Krishna?- O Janardana, although these people, whose hearts have become perverted by greed, do not see the evil arising from destroying the family and sinning in hostility towards friends, yet how can we, who clearly see the evil arising from destroying the family, remain unaware of the need to abstain from this sin?Why should we not, who clearly see the evil in the destruction of families, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana (Krishna)?But, perceiving clearly the evil consequences ensuing from the ruin of the family, should we not have sense enough to refrain from this sinful act, O Janardana?Should we not, whose eyes are open and who consider it wrong to annihilate our family, turn away from such a great crime?

With the ruin of a clan, its ancient traditions perish, and when traditions perish, lawlessness overtakes the whole clan.From the ruin of the family, the traditional rites and duties are totally destroyed. When rites and duties are destroyed, vice overwhelms the entire family.In the destruction of a family, the immemorial religious rites of that family perish; on the destruction of spirituality, impiety indeed, overwhelms the whole family.When a family ruins, the eternal duties of the family perish; when the duties perish, impiety inevitably dominates the entire family.The destruction of our kindred means the destruction of the traditions of our ancient lineage, and when these are lost, irreligion will overrun our homes.When lawlessness prevails, O Krsna, the women of the clan become corrupted; when women become corrupted, there arises an intermixing of classes.O Krishna, when vice predominates, the women of the family become corrupt. O descendant of the Vrsnis, when women become corrupted, it results in the intermingling of castes.O Krishna, by the prevalence of impiety, the women of the family become corrupt; and, when women are corrupted, O Varshenya (descendant of Vrishni), intermingling of castes arises.O Krsna, due to the domination of impiety, the women of the family become corrupt. O member of the Vrsni-clan, when the women become corrupt, there arises the intermixture of castes.When irreligion spreads, the women of the house start to stray; when they lose their purity, adulteration of the lineage follows.This mixing of classes leads to hell for the clan itself and its destroyers; for the spirits of their ancestors fall degraded, deprived of the ritual offerings of food and water.And the intermingling in the family leads the ruiners of the family verily into hell. The forefathers of these fall down (into hell) due to being deprived of the offerings of rice-balls and water.Confusion of castes leads to hell for the slayers of the family, for their forebears fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-balls and libations of water.The intermixture leads the family-ruiners and their families to nothing but hell; for, their ancestors (their individual souls) fall down [in hell], being deprived of the rites of offering rice-balls and water [intended for them].Promiscuity ruins both the family and those who defile it; while the souls of our ancestors droop, due to the lack of funeral cakes and ablutions.By the sins of the clan-destroyers who bring about intermixing of classes, the ancient traditions of the clans and classes are destroyed.Due to the misdeeds of the ruiners of the family, which cause intermingling of castes, the traditional rites and duties of the castes and families are destroyed.By these evil deeds of the destroyers of the family, which cause confusion of castes, the eternal religious rites of the caste and the family are destroyed.On account of these evils of the family-ruiners that cause the intermixing of castes, the eternal caste-duties and family-duties fall into disuse.By the destruction of our lineage and the pollution of our blood, ancient class traditions and family purity alike perish.For those whose clan laws are destroyed, dwelling in hell is ordained, O Krishna; thus, we have heard.O Janardana, we have heard that living in hell is inevitable for those whose family duties are destroyed.We have heard, O Janardana, that those men in whose families the religious practices have been destroyed are inevitably destined to dwell in hell for an unknown period.O Janardana! Dwelling in hell is certain for men whose family duties have fallen into disuse; this we have heard.The wise say, my Lord, that they are forever lost whose ancient traditions have been lost.Alas! We have resolved to commit a great sin, for we are ready to slay our kin out of desire for sovereignty and enjoyment.What a pity that we have resolved to commit a great sin, eager to kill our own kith and kin out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom!Alas! We are involved in a great sin, for we are prepared to kill our kinsmen, out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.Alas! What a great sin have we resolved to commit! For, out of greed for the joy of the kingdom, we are striving to slay our own kinfolk!Alas, it is strange that we should be willing to kill our own countrymen and commit a great sin, in order to enjoy the pleasures of kingdom.If the well-armed sons of Dhrtarastra should slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.If, in this battle, the sons of Dhrtarastra, armed with weapons, kill me, who am non-resistant and unarmed, that will be more beneficial for me.If the sons of Dhritarashtra, with weapons in hand, should slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.It would be more beneficial for me if Dhrtarastra's men, with weapons in their hands, should slay me, unresisting and unarmed.If, on the contrary, the sons of Dhritarashtra, with weapons in hand, should slay me, unarmed and unresisting, surely that would be better for my welfare!Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus on the battlefield, Arjuna threw aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot seat, his heart overwhelmed with grief.Sanjaya narrated: Having said so, Arjuna, with a mind afflicted by sorrow, sat down on the chariot in the midst of the battle, casting aside his bow along with the arrows.Sanjaya said, Having thus spoken in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna cast away his bow and arrow and, his mind overwhelmed with sorrow, sat down on the seat of the chariot.Sanjaya said, Having said this much about the battle, and letting his bow and arrows fall, Arjuna sat down on the back of the chariot, his mind agitated with grief.Sanjaya said: "Having spoken thus, Arjuna sank into the seat of his chariot, discarding his bow and arrow, overwhelmed with grief in the midst of the armies."Sanjaya said: To him, who was overcome with pity, whose eyes were wet with tears, who was sorrow-stricken and bore a bewildered look, Sri Krishna spoke as follows:Sanjaya said: To him who had been filled with pity, whose eyes were filled with tears and showed distress, and who was sorrowing, Madhusudana uttered these words.Sanjaya said: To him, who was thus overcome with pity, despondent, with eyes full of tears and agitated, Madhusudana (the destroyer of Madhu) or Krishna spoke these words.Sanjaya said: To him, who was thus possessed by compassion, whose eyes were confused and filled with tears, and who was sinking in despondency, Madhusudana spoke the following words.Sanjaya then told how the Lord Shri Krishna, seeing Arjuna overwhelmed with compassion, his eyes dimmed with flowing tears and full of despondency, consoled him:The Lord said, "Whence comes this despondency upon you, O Arjuna, in this crisis? It is unfitting for a noble person; it is disgraceful and it obstructs one's attainment of heaven."The Blessed Lord said, "O Arjuna, in this perilous place, whence has this impurity come to you, entertained by unenlightened persons, which does not lead to heaven and brings infamy?"The Blessed Lord said, "From whence has this perilous strait come upon you, this dejection which is unworthy of you, disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon you, O Arjuna?"The Bhagavat said, "O Arjuna! At this critical moment, whence did this sinful act come to you, which is practiced by men of low birth and leads to hell, and is inglorious?"The Lord said: My beloved friend! Why yield to this weakness, on the eve of battle, which does no credit to those who call themselves Aryans and only brings them infamy, barring them from the gates of heaven?Do not yield to unmanliness, O Arjuna, it does not befit you. Shake off this base faint-heartedness and arise, O conqueror of foes!O Partha, do not yield to unmanliness. This does not befit you. O scorcher of foes, arise, giving up the petty weakness of heart.Do not yield to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha. It does not befit you. Cast off this mean weakness of the heart! Stand up, O conqueror of foes!Do not stoop to unmanliness, O son of Kunti! It does not befit you. Shunning the petty weakness of heart, arise, O scorcher of foes!O Arjuna! Why give way to unmanliness? O thou, who art the terror of thy enemies! Shake off such shameful effeminacy and make ready to act!Arjuna said, "O slayer of foes, how can I aim arrows in battle against Bhisma and Drona, who are worthy of reverence?"Arjuna said, "O Madhusudana, O destroyer of enemies, how can I fight with arrows in battle against Bhisma and Drona, who are worthy of adoration?"Arjuna said, "O Madhusudana, how can I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of being worshipped, O destroyer of enemies?"Arjuna said, "How can I fight in battle with arrows against Bhisma and Drona, both of whom are worthy of reverence? O slayer of Mandhu, O slayer of foes!"Arjuna argued: My Lord! How can I, when the battle rages, send an arrow through Bheeshma and Drona, whom I should revere?It is better even to live on a beggar's fare in this world than to slay these most venerable teachers. If I were to slay my teachers, though they may be degraded by desire for wealth, I would only be enjoying blood-stained pleasures here.Rather than killing the noble-minded elders, it is better in this world to live even on alms. But by killing them, we shall only be enjoying here the pleasures of wealth and desirable things drenched in blood.Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if I were to kill them, even in this world, all my enjoyments of wealth and fulfilled desires would be stained with their blood.It is indeed good to go about begging in this world without killing the elders of great dignity; however, I would not enjoy, with greed for wealth, the blood-stained objects of pleasure by killing my elders.Rather, I would be content with a beggar's crust than to kill these teachers of mine, these precious noble souls! To slay these masters who are my benefactors would be to stain the sweetness of life's pleasures with their blood.We do not know which of the two is better for us: whether our vanquishing them or their vanquishing us. The very sons of Dhrtarastra, whom, if we were to slay, we would not wish to live, even they are standing in array against us.We do not know which is better for us, whether we shall win or they shall conquer us. Those very sons of Dhrtarastra, whom we do not wish to kill, stand in confrontation.I can hardly tell which would be better, that we should conquer them or that they should conquer us. Even the sons of Dhritarashtra, whom we do not wish to slay, stand facing us.Whether we should conquer in the battle, or they should conquer us—we do not know which is better for us. For, having killed whom, we would not wish to live at all, the same persons stand before us as Dhrtarastra's men.Nor can I say whether it would be better for them to conquer me or for me to conquer them, since I would no longer care to live if I killed these sons of Dhritarashtra, who are now preparing for battle.With my heart stricken by the fault of weak compassion, my mind perplexed about my duty, I implore you to tell me for certain what is good for me. I am your disciple; teach me, who have taken refuge in you.With my nature overpowered by weak commiseration, my mind bewildered about duty, I supplicate You. Tell me for certain what is better; I am Your disciple, having taken refuge in You. Instruct me.My heart is overpowered by the taint of pity; my mind is confused as to my duty. I ask Thee: Tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple; instruct me, who has taken refuge in Thee.With my very nature, overpowered by the taint of pity, and with my mind, utterly confused as to the right action at this present juncture, I ask you: Tell me definitely what would be good for me; I am your pupil; please teach me, who is taking refuge in You.My heart is oppressed with pity, and my mind is confused as to what my duty is. Therefore, my Lord, tell me what is best for my spiritual welfare, for I am Your disciple. Please direct me, I pray.Even if I were to win unchallenged sovereignty of a prosperous earth or even lordship over the Devas, I do not feel that it would dispel the grief that withers up my senses.For I do not see anything that, even after acquiring on this earth a prosperous kingdom free from enemies and even sovereignty over the gods, can remove my sorrow that is blasting the senses.I do not see that this sorrow that burns up my senses would be removed, even if I were to attain prosperous and unrivaled dominion on earth or lordship over the gods.I do not clearly see what would drive out my grief, the scorcher of my senses, even after achieving a prosperous and unrivaled kingship on this earth and also the overlordship of the gods in the heavens.For even if I were to attain the monarchy of the visible world, or the sovereignty over the invisible world, it would not drive away the anguish that is now paralyzing my senses.Sanjaya said, Having thus spoken to Sri Krsna, Arjuna, the conqueror of sleep and the scorcher of foes, said, "I will not fight," and became silent.Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus to Hrsikesa (Krsna), Gudakesa (Arjuna), the afflictor of foes, verily became silent, telling Govinda, 'I shall not fight.'Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha, the Lord of the senses, Arjuna, the conqueror of sleep and destroyer of foes, said, "I will not fight," and became silent.Sanjaya said, "O scorcher of foes, Dhrtarastra! Having spoken to Hrsikesa, the master of sense-organs, Govinda, in this manner, and having declared, 'I will not fight,' Gudakesa became silent!"Sanjaya continued: "Arjuna, the conqueror of all enemies, then told the Lord of All-Hearts that he would not fight, and became silent, O King!O King, to him who was thus sorrowing between the two armies, Sri Krishna spoke the following words, as if smiling (by way of ridicule).O descendant of Bharata, Hrsikesa, mocking as it were, said these words to him who was sorrowing between the two armies:To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Krishna, smiling, O Bharata, spoke these words.O descendant of Bharata, Hrsikesa, as if smiling, spoke to him who was sinking in despondency between two armies.Thereupon, the Lord, with a gracious smile, addressed him who was so much depressed in the midst of the two armies.The Lord said, "You grieve for those who should not be grieved for; yet you speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the dead nor for the living."The Blessed Lord said, "You grieve for those who are not to be grieved for; and you speak words of wisdom! The learned do not grieve for the departed nor for those who have not departed.The Blessed Lord said, "You have grieved for those who should not be grieved for; yet, you speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead."While lamenting for those who cannot be lamented on and those who do not deserve to be lamented on, you do not speak like a wise man! The learned do not lament for those who have departed life and those who have not departed life.Lord Shri Krishna said: Why grieve for those for whom no grief is due, yet professing wisdom? The wise grieve neither for the dead nor the living.There never was a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor any of these kings. Nor will there be any time in the future when all of us shall cease to exist.But certainly it is not a fact that I did not exist at any time; nor you, nor these rulers of men. And surely it is not that we all shall cease to exist after this.Nor, at any time, was I not, nor thou, nor these rulers of men; nor, verily, shall we ever cease to be hereafter.Never indeed at any time did I not exist, nor you, nor these kings; and never shall we all not exist hereafter.There was never a time when I was not, nor you, nor these princes were not; there will never be a time when we shall cease to exist.Just as the self associated with a body passes through childhood, youth, and old age, so too, at death, it passes into another body. A wise man is not deluded by that.As boyhood, youth, and decrepitude are to an embodied being in this present body, so is the acquisition of another body. Therefore, an intelligent person does not get deluded.Just as the embodied soul passes through childhood, youth, and old age in this body, so too does it pass into another body; the steadfast one does not grieve over this.Just as boyhood, youth, and old age come to the embodied soul in this body, so too is the attainment of another body; the wise man is not deluded by this.As the soul experiences infancy, youth, and old age in this body, so finally it passes into another; the wise have no delusion about this.The contact of the senses with their objects, O Arjuna, gives rise to feelings of cold and heat, pleasure and pain. They come and go, never lasting long. Endure them, O Arjuna.But the contacts of the organs with the objects are the producers of cold and heat, happiness, and sorrow. They have a beginning and an end and are transient. Bear them, O descendant of Bharata.The contact of the senses with the objects, O son of Kunti, which causes heat and cold, pleasure and pain, has a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O Arjuna.O son of Kunti! The touches with the matras cause feelings of cold and heat, pleasure and pain; they are of the nature of coming and going and are transient. Bear them, O Descendant of Bharata!Those external relations that bring cold and heat, pain and happiness come and go; they are not permanent. Endure them bravely, O Prince!For, he whom these do not affect, O chief of men, and to whom pain and pleasure are equal - that steadfast man alone is worthy of immortality.O Arjuna, who is foremost among men, verily, the person whom these do not torment, the wise man to whom sorrow and happiness are the same—he is fit for immortality.That firm man, whom surely these afflictions do not, O chief among men, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality.O best among persons! That wise person becomes immortal, whom these situations do not trouble, and to whom pleasure and pain are equal.The hero whose soul is unmoved by circumstances, who accepts pleasure and pain with equanimity, is only fit for immortality.The unreal never comes into being, the real never ceases to be. The truth about these two is seen by the seers.There is no being of the unreal; the real has no non-existence. Yet, the nature of both has been realized by the seers of Truth.The unreal has no being; there is no non-being of the real; the truth about both has been seen by the knowers of the truth (or the seers of the essence).Birth does not happen to what is non-existent, and destruction to what is existent; the finality of these two has been seen by the seers of reality.That which is not shall never be; that which is shall never cease to be. These truths are self-evident to the wise.Know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. No one can cause the destruction of this immutable.But know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. No one can bring about the destruction of this immutable.Know that to be indestructible, by which all this is pervaded. No one can cause the destruction of that, the Imperishable.And know That to be indestructible, by Which all this (universe) is pervaded; no one is capable of causing destruction to this unchanging One.The Spirit, which pervades all that is seen, is imperishable. Nothing can destroy it.These bodies of the Jiva (the embodied self) are said to have an end, while the Jiva itself is eternal, indestructible, and incomprehensible. Therefore, fight, O Bharata (Arjuna).These destructible bodies are said to belong to the everlasting, indestructible, and indeterminable embodied One. Therefore, O descendant of Bharata, join the battle.These bodies of the embodied Self, which are eternal, indestructible, and immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna.These physical bodies, which have an end and suffer destruction, are declared to belong to the eternal, embodied Soul, which is indestructible and incomprehensible. Therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata!The material bodies that this Eternal, Indestructible, and Immeasurable Spirit inhabits are all finite; therefore, fight, O valiant man!He who considers It (the self) to be the slayer, and he who thinks of It as slain—both are ignorant. For, the self neither slays nor is being slain.He who thinks of this One as the killer, and he who thinks of this One as the one being killed, both of them do not know. This One neither kills nor is It killed.He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks it is slain, neither of them knows. It does not slay, nor is it slain.Whoever views This as the slayer and whoever believes This to be the slain, both of them do not understand: This does not slay, nor is This slain.He who thinks that the Spirit kills, and he who thinks of it as killed, are both ignorant. The Spirit neither kills nor is it killed.It is never born; it never dies; having come into existence once, it never ceases to exist. Unborn, eternal, perpetual, and primordial, it is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.Never is this One born, nor does It ever die; nor, having come into existence, does It cease to be. This One is birthless, eternal, undecaying, and ancient; It is not killed when the body is killed.It is not born, nor does it ever die; after having been, it again does not cease to be; unborn, eternal, changeless, and ancient, it is not killed when the body is killed.This is neither born nor ever dies; nor, having not been at one time, will it come to be again. It is unborn, destructionless, eternal, and ancient, and is not slain even when the body is slain.It was not born; it will never die, nor, once having been, can it cease to exist. Unborn, eternal, ever-enduring, yet most ancient, the spirit does not die when the body is dead.He who knows this self to be indestructible, unborn, unchanging, and thus eternal—how, O Arjuna, does he cause anyone to be killed, and whom does he kill?O Partha, he who knows this One as indestructible, eternal, birthless, and undecaying—how can that person kill, or cause to be killed, whom?Whoever knows it to be indestructible, eternal, unborn, and inexhaustible, how can that person slay, O Arjuna, or cause to be slain?Whoever realizes this to be changeless, destructionless, unborn, and immutable, how can that person be slain? How can they slay anyone else? O son of Prtha!He who knows the Spirit to be indestructible, immortal, unborn, and always the same, how should he kill or cause to be killed?As a man casts off worn-out garments and puts on new ones, so does the embodied self cast off its worn-out bodies and enter into new ones.As after rejecting worn-out clothes, a man takes up other new ones, likewise, after rejecting worn-out bodies, the embodied one unites with other new ones.Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so too the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others that are new.Just as a man rejects tattered garments and takes on new ones, so too, the embodied Self, discarding worn-out bodies, rightly obtains new ones.As a man discards his threadbare robes and puts on new ones, so the Spirit throws off its worn-out bodies and takes on fresh ones.Weapons cannot cleave It, fire cannot burn It, waters cannot wet It, and wind cannot dry It.Weapons cannot cut It, fire cannot burn It, water cannot moisten It, and air cannot dry It.Weapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot wet it, wind cannot dry it.Weapons cannot cut This; fire cannot burn This; water cannot make This wet; and the wind cannot make This dry.Weapons cannot cleave it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot drench it, and wind cannot dry it.It cannot be cleaved; It cannot be burned; It cannot be wetted, and It cannot be dried; It is eternal, all-pervasive, stable, immovable, and primordial.It cannot be cut, burned, moistened, or dried up; it is eternal, omnipresent, stationary, unmoving, and unchanging.This Self cannot be cut, burned, wetted, nor dried up; it is eternal, all-pervasive, stable, immovable, and ancient.This cannot be cut; this cannot be burnt; this cannot be made wet nor dried; this is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, and everlasting.It is impenetrable; it cannot be drowned, scorched, or dried. It is eternal, all-pervasive, unchanging, immovable, and most ancient.This (self) is said to be unmanifest, inconceivable, and unchanging. Therefore, knowing it thus, it does not befit you to grieve.It is said that This is unmanifest; This is inconceivable; This is unchangeable. Therefore, having known This thus, you ought not to grieve.This Self is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable, and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing this to be so, you should not grieve.This is declared to be non-evident, imponderable, and unchangeable. Therefore, understanding this as such, you should not lament.It is named the Unmanifest, the Unthinkable, and the immutable. Therefore, knowing the Spirit as such, you have no cause to grieve.Or, if you consider this self as constantly being born and constantly dying, O mighty-armed one, it still does not become you to feel grief.On the other hand, if you think this One is born continually or constantly dies, even then, O mighty-armed one, you should not grieve.But even if thou thinkest of It as constantly being born and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed one, thou shouldst not grieve.On the other hand, if you deem this as being born constantly or as dying constantly, even then, O mighty-armed one, you should not lament.Even if thou thinkest of it as constantly being born and constantly dying, O Mighty Man, thou still hast no cause to grieve.For, death is certain for the born, and rebirth is certain for the dead; therefore, you should not grieve for what is inevitable.For the death of anyone born is certain, and the rebirth of the dead is certain. Therefore, you should not grieve over an inevitable fact.For the born, death is certain, and for the dead, birth is certain; therefore, you should not grieve over the inevitable.Death is certain indeed for what is born; and birth is certain for the dead. Therefore, you should not lament over something that is unavoidable.For death is certain for that which is born, just as birth is certain for that which is dead. Therefore, do not grieve for what is inevitable.O Arjuna, beings have an unknown beginning, a known middle, and an unknown end. What is there to grieve about in all this?O descendant of Bharata, all beings remain unmanifested in the beginning; they become manifested in the middle. After death, they certainly become unmanifested. What lamentation can there be for them?Beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their middle state, O Arjuna, and unmanifest again in their end. What is there to grieve about?O descendant of Bharata! The beings have an unmanifest beginning, a manifest middle, and an unmanifest end. Therefore, why mourn?The end and beginning of beings are unknown; we only see the intervening formations. So, what is there to grieve about?One regards This (self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; yet another hears of It as a wonder; and even after hearing of It, one does not know It.Someone visualizes it as a wonder; someone else talks of it as a wonder; someone else hears of it as a wonder; and yet someone else does not even realize it after hearing about it.One sees this (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of it as a wonder; another hears of it as a wonder; yet, having heard, none understands it at all.This someone observes as a wonder; similarly, another speaks of This as a wonder; another hears This as a wonder; but even after hearing, not even one understands This.One hears of the Spirit with surprise, another thinks it marvelous, the third listens without comprehending. Thus, though many are told about it, scarcely is there one who knows it.The self in the body, O Arjuna, is eternal and indestructible. This is the case for all selves in all bodies. Therefore, it is not fitting for you to feel grief for any being.O descendant of Bharata, this embodied Self existing in everyone's body can never be killed; therefore, you ought not to grieve for all these beings.This indweller in the body of everyone is ever indestructible, O Arjuna; therefore, you should not grieve for any creature.O descendant of Bharata! This embodied One in the body of everyone is ever incapable of being slain. Therefore, you should not lament over all beings.Do not be anxious about these armies; the spirit in man is imperishable.Further, considering also your own duty, it does not befit you to waver. For, to a Kshatriya, there is no greater good than a righteous war.Even considering your own duty, you should not waver, since there is nothing better for a Ksatriya than a righteous battle.Further, having regard to your duty, you should not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.Further, considering your own duty, you should not waver. Indeed, for a Kshatriya there is no duty superior to fighting a righteous war.You must look at your duty. Nothing can be more welcome to a soldier than a righteous war. Therefore, wavering in this resolve is unworthy, O Arjuna!Happy are the Ksatriyas, O Arjuna, to whom such a war comes of its own accord; it opens the gates to heaven.O son of Partha, happy are the Kshatriyas who come across such a battle, which presents itself unsought and is an open gate to heaven.Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Arjuna! who are called to fight in such a battle that comes of its own accord as an open door to heaven.O son of Prtha! By good fortune, Ksatriyas, desirous of happiness, get a war of this type, which has come of its own accord and which is an open door to heaven.Blessed are the soldiers who find their opportunity; this opportunity has opened for thee the gates of heaven.But if you do not fight this righteous war, you will be turning away from your duty and honor, and will incur sin.On the other hand, if you do not fight this righteous battle, then you will incur sin, forsaking your own duty and fame.But if you will not fight this righteous war, then having abandoned your own duty and reputation, you will incur sin.On the other hand, if you do not fight this righteous war, then you will incur sin by shirking your own duty and forfeiting your fame.Refuse to fight in this righteous cause, and you will be a traitor, losing fame, incurring only sin.Further, people will speak ill of you for all time, and for one accustomed to being honored, dishonor is worse than death.People also will speak of your unending infamy, and to an honored person, infamy is worse than death.People will also recount your everlasting dishonor; and for one who has been honored, dishonor is worse than death.The creatures will speak of your endless ill-fame; and for one who has been highly esteemed, ill-fame is worse than death.Men will talk forever of thy disgrace; and to the noble, dishonor is worse than death.The great warriors will think that you have fled from battle out of fear. Those who held you in high esteem will now speak of you disparagingly.The great chariot-riders will think of you as having desisted from the fight out of fear, and you will fall into disgrace before them whom you had been estimable to.The great chariot-warriors will think that you have withdrawn from the battle out of fear, and you will be held in low esteem by those who have held you in high regard.The mighty charioteers will think of you as having withdrawn from the battle out of fear; having been highly esteemed by these men, you will be viewed lightly.Great generals will think that you have fled from the battlefield out of cowardice; though once honored, you will seem despicable.Your enemies, slandering your prowess, will use words that should never be uttered. What could be more painful than that?And your enemies will speak many indecent words while denigrating your power. What can be more painful than that?Your enemies, scoffing at your power, will speak many abusive words—what could be more painful than this?Your enemies will slander your abilities and speak of you in many sayings that should not be spoken. Is there anything more painful than that?Your enemies will spread scandal and mock your courage. Is there anything more humiliating?If slain, you will win heaven; or if victorious, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore, arise, O Arjuna, resolved to fight.Either by being killed, you will attain heaven, or by winning, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore, O Arjuna, rise up with determination to fight.Slain, you will obtain heaven; victorious, you will enjoy the earth; therefore, stand up, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight.If you are slain, you shall attain heaven; or if you conquer, you shall enjoy the earth. Therefore, O son of Kunti, stand up with resolution made in favor of fighting the battle.If you are killed, you will attain Heaven; if you are victorious, you will enjoy the kingdom of earth. Therefore, arise, O Son of Kunti, and fight!Holding pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat as equal, gird yourself up for the battle. Thus, you shall not incur any sin.Treating happiness and sorrow, gain and loss, and conquest and defeat with equanimity, then engage in battle. Thus, you will not incur sin.Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat equal, engage in battle for the sake of battle; thus, you shall not incur sin.Viewing pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat alike, you should get yourself ready for the battle. Thus, you will not incur sin.Look upon pleasure and pain, victory and defeat, with an equal eye. Be prepared for the combat, and you will commit no sin.This Buddhi concerning the Self (Sankhya) has been imparted to you. Now listen to this with regard to Yoga, by following which you will get rid of the bondage of Karma.O Partha, this wisdom has been imparted to you from the standpoint of Self-realization. But listen to this wisdom from the standpoint of Yoga, endowed with which, you will get rid of the bondage of action.This, which has been taught to you, is wisdom concerning Sankhya. Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, you shall cast off the bonds of action.Listen, how this knowledge, imparted to you for your Sankhya, is also for the Yoga; endowed with this knowledge, you shall cast off the bondage of action, O son of Prtha!I have told you the philosophy of knowledge. Now, listen, and I will explain the philosophy of action, by means of which, O Arjuna, you will break through the bondage of all action.Here, there is no loss of effort, nor any accrual of evil. Even a little of this Dharma (called Karma Yoga) protects one from the great fear.Here, there is no waste of effort; nor is there any harm. Even a little of this righteousness saves one from great fear.In this, there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm produced, nor any transgression. Even a little of this knowledge protects one from great fear.Here, there is no loss due to transgression, and there is no contrary downward course (sin); even a little of this righteous thing can save one from great danger.On this path, endeavour is never wasted nor repressed. Even a little practice of it protects one from great danger.In this (Karma Yoga), O Arjuna, the resolute mind is single-pointed; the minds of the irresolute are multi-branched and endless.O scion of the Kuru dynasty, in this there is a single, one-pointed conviction. The thoughts of the irresolute ones, however, have many branches indeed and are innumerable.Here, O joy of the Kurus, there is only one single-pointed determination; many-branched and endless are the thoughts of the indecisive.O source of joy to the Kurus! The knowledge in the form of determination is one; however, the knowledge (thoughts) of those who lack determination has many branches and has no end.By its means, the straying intellect becomes steadied in contemplating one object only; whereas the minds of the irresolute stray into innumerable bypaths.- O Partha, the unwise, who rejoice in the letter of the Vedas, say, "There is nothing else." They are full only of worldly desires and they hanker for heaven. They speak flowery words that offer mirth as the fruit of work. They look upon the Vedas as consisting entirely of varied rites for the attainment of pleasure and power. Those who cling so to pleasure and power are attracted by that speech (offering heavenly rewards) and are unable to develop the resolute will of a concentrated mind.O son of Prtha, those undiscerning people who utter this flowery talk, which promises birth as a result of rites and duties, and is full of various special rites meant for the attainment of enjoyment and affluence, remain engrossed in the utterances of the Vedas and declare that nothing else exists; their minds are full of desires and they have heaven as their goal.The unwise, taking pleasure in the eulogizing words of the Vedas, utter flowery speech, saying, "There is nothing else," O Arjuna.-. O son of Prtha! Those whose very nature is desire, whose goal is heaven, who esteem only the Vedic declaration [of fruits], who declare that there is nothing else, who proclaim this flowery speech about the paths to the lordship of the objects of enjoyment—paths that are full of different actions—and who desire action alone as a fruit of their birth—they are men without insight.Only the ignorant speak in figurative language; it is they who extol the letter of the scriptures, saying, "There is nothing deeper than this."- O Partha, the unwise, who rejoice in the letter of the Vedas, say, "There is nothing else." They are full only of worldly desires and they yearn for heaven. They speak flowery words that offer mirth as the fruit of work. They view the Vedas as consisting entirely of varied rites for the attainment of pleasure and power. Those who cling so to pleasure and power are attracted by that speech (offering heavenly rewards) and are unable to develop the resolute will of a focused mind.O son of Prtha, those undiscerning people who utter this flowery talk, which promises birth as a result of rites and duties, and is full of various special rites meant for the attainment of enjoyment and affluence, remain engrossed in the utterances of the Vedas and declare that nothing else exists; their minds are full of desires and they have heaven as their goal.Full of desires, with heaven as their goal, (they speak words that are directed to ends) leading to new births as the result of their works, and prescribe various methods abounding in specific actions, for the attainment of pleasure and power.-. O son of Prtha! Those whose very nature is desire, whose goal is heaven, who esteem only the Vedic declaration [of fruits], who declare that there is nothing else, who proclaim this flowery speech about the paths to the lordship of the objects of enjoyment—paths that are full of different actions—and who desire action alone as a fruit of their birth—they are men without insight.Consulting only their own desires, they construct their own heaven, devising arduous and complex rites to secure their own pleasure and power; and the only result is rebirth.- O Partha, the unwise, who rejoice in the letter of the Vedas, say, "There is nothing else." They are full only of worldly desires and they hanker for heaven. They speak flowery words that offer mirth as the fruit of work. They look upon the Vedas as consisting entirely of varied rites for the attainment of pleasure and power. Those who cling so to pleasure and power are attracted by that speech (offering heavenly rewards) and are unable to develop the resolute will of a concentrated mind.One-pointed conviction does not become established in the minds of those who delight in enjoyment and affluence, and whose intellects are carried away by it.For those who are attached to pleasure and power, whose minds are drawn away by such teachings, their determinate reason is not formed which is steadily bent on meditation and Samadhi (superconscious state).Those who are very attached to the ownership of enjoyable objects and whose minds have been carried away by that (flowery speech) - their knowledge, in the form of determination, is not prescribed for concentration.While their minds are absorbed with thoughts of power and personal enjoyment, they cannot focus their discrimination on one point.The Vedas have the three Gunas as their sphere, O Arjuna. You must be free from the three Gunas and be free from the pairs of opposites. Abide in pure Sattva; never care to acquire things and to protect what has been acquired, but be established in the Self.O Arjuna, the Vedas [Meaning only the portion dealing with rites and duties (karma-kanda).] have the three qualities as their object. You become free from worldliness, free from the pairs of duality, ever-poised in the quality of sattva, without (desire for) acquisition and protection, and self-collected.The Vedas deal with the three attributes; be thou above these three attributes. O Arjuna, free yourself from the pairs of opposites and ever remain in the quality of Sattva, freed from acquisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.The Vedas bind through the three strands. Therefore, O Arjuna, be free from the three strands, free from the pairs of opposites; be established in this eternal Being; be free from acquisition and preservation; and possess the Self.The Vedic Scriptures tell of the three constituents of life—the Qualities. Rise above all of them, O Arjuna, above all the pairs of opposing sensations; be steadfast in truth, free from worldly anxieties, and centered in the Self.What use does a thirsty person have for a water reservoir when all sides of it are flooded—that is the only use of all the Vedas for a Brahmana who knows.A Brahmana with realization has that much utility in all the Vedas as a person has in a well when there is a flood all around.To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as a reservoir of water would be in a place where there is a flood.What portion of a reservoir, flooded with water everywhere, is useful for a man in thirst? That much portion alone in all the Vedas is useful for an intelligent student of the Vedas.As a man can drink water from any side of a full tank, so the skilled theologian can extract from any scripture that which will serve their purpose.You have the right to work alone, but not to the fruits of it. Do not be driven by the results of your work, nor have attachment to inaction.Your right is only to act, not to the results. Do not be the cause of the results of action. Do not have any inclination towards inaction.Your right is only to work, but not to its results; do not let the results of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.Let your claim rest on action alone and never on the fruits; you should never be the cause of the fruits of action; let not your attachment be to inaction.But you have only the right to work, but none to the fruit of it. Let not the fruit of your action be your motive; nor be you enamored of inaction.Abandoning attachment and established in Yoga, perform works, viewing success and failure with an even mind. Evenness of mind is said to be Yoga.By being established in Yoga, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), undertake actions, casting off attachment and remaining equanimous in success and failure. Equanimity is called Yoga.Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure; evenness of mind is called Yoga.O Dhananjaya! Establish yourself in the Yoga, perform actions while abandoning attachment, and remain even-minded in success and failure; for, even-mindedness is said to be the Yoga.Revised:
Perform all your actions with your mind concentrated on the Divine, renouncing attachment and looking upon success and failure with an equal eye. Spirituality implies equanimity.Action done with attachment, O Arjuna, is far inferior to action done with evenness of mind. Seek refuge in evenness of mind; those who act with a motive for results are miserable.O Dhananjaya, indeed, action is inferior to the yoga of wisdom. Take refuge in wisdom. Those who thirst for rewards are pitiable.Far lower than the Yoga of wisdom is action, O Arjuna. Seek thou refuge in wisdom; wretched are those whose motive is the fruit.O Dhananjaya! The inferior action stays away at a distance due to the yoga of one's contact with the determining faculty; in the determining faculty, you must seek refuge; wretched are those who are the cause of the fruits of action.Physical action is far inferior to an intellect concentrated on the Divine. Therefore, have recourse to Pure Intelligence. It is only the small-minded who work for reward.A person with an evenness of mind discards both good and evil here and now. Therefore, strive for Yoga; for Yoga is skill in action.Possessed of wisdom, one rejects here both virtue and vice. Therefore, devote yourself to (Karma-) yoga; for yoga is skilfulness in action.Endowed with wisdom and evenness of mind, one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds; therefore, devote yourself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in action.Whoever is endowed with the faculty of determination casts off both good and bad actions. Therefore, strive for Yoga, which is proficiency in action.When a person attains Pure Reason, they renounce in this world the results of both good and evil. Cling to Right Action. Spirituality is the true art of living.The wise, who possess evenness of mind, relinquish the fruits born of action, and are freed from the bondage of birth, going to the region beyond all ills.For those devoted to wisdom, they become enlightened men by giving up the fruits of their actions, and thus they reach a state beyond evil, having been freed from the bondage of birth.The wise, possessing knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, and being freed from the bonds of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil.By renouncing the fruits of their actions, the intelligent ones, endowed with the power of determination and freed from the bonds of birth, go to a place that is free from illness.The sages, guided by pure intellect, renounce the fruits of their actions; and, thus freed from the shackles of rebirth, they attain the highest bliss.When your intellect has passed beyond the tangle of delusion, you will yourself feel disgusted with what you have heard and what you will hear.When your mind goes beyond the turbidity of delusion, then you will acquire dispassion for what has to be heard and what has already been heard.When your intellect passes beyond the mire of delusion, then you will attain indifference to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard.When your determining faculty surpasses the impenetrable thicket of delusion, then you will attain an attitude of futility regarding what needs to be heard and what has been heard.When your reason has crossed the entanglements of illusion, then you will become indifferent to both the philosophies you have heard and those you may yet hear.When your intellect, having been well enlightened by hearing from Me and firmly placed, stands unshaken in a concentrated mind, then you will attain the vision of the Self.When your mind, which has become bewildered by hearing, becomes unshakable and steadfast in the Self, then you will attain Yoga that arises from discrimination.When your intellect, which is perplexed by the Vedic texts you have read, stands immovable and steady in the Self, then you will attain Self-realization.When your determining faculty, which had been previously confused by your hearing of scriptural declarations of fruits, stands stable in concentration, then you shall attain Yoga.When the intellect, bewildered by the multiplicity of holy scriptures, stands unperturbed in blissful contemplation of the infinite, then you have attained spirituality.Arjuna said, "What is the mode of speech of one who is of firm wisdom, established in the control of the mind? What does a man of firm wisdom speak, O Krsna? How does he sit? How does he move?"Arjuna said, "O Kesava, what is the description of a man of steady wisdom who is self-absorbed? How does he speak, sit, and move about?"Arjuna said, "O Krishna, what is the description of one who has steady wisdom and is merged in the superconscious state? How does one of steady wisdom speak, how do they sit, and how do they walk?"Arjuna said, "O Kesava! What is the meaning of sthita-prajna (a man-of-stabilized-intellect) when applied to a man fixed in concentration? What does sthira-dhih (the fixed-minded) imply? Where does the fixed-minded abide? And what is their goal?"Arjuna asked: My Lord! How can we recognize the saint who has attained Pure Intellect, who has reached this state of Bliss, and whose mind is steady? How does he talk, how does he live, and how does he act?The Lord said, "When a man renounces all the desires of the mind and is content with himself, then he is said to possess firm wisdom."The Blessed One said, "O Partha, when one fully renounces all the desires that have entered the mind and remains satisfied in the Self alone, then he is called a man of steady wisdom."The Blessed Lord said, "When a man completely casts off, O Arjuna, all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then he is said to be one of steady wisdom."The Bhagavat said, "O son of Prtha! When a man casts off all desires existing in his mind and remains content in the Self by the self (mind), then he is called a man of stabilized intellect."Lord Shri Krishna replied: When a person has given up the desires of their heart and is content with the Self alone, they have surely reached the highest state.He whose mind is not perturbed by pain, who has no longing for pleasures, who is free from desire, fear, and anger—he is called a sage of firm wisdom.That monk is called a man of steady wisdom when his mind is unperturbed even in sorrow, he is free from longing for delights, and has gone beyond attachment, fear, and anger.He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not long for pleasures, and is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.He whose mind is undisturbed amidst sorrows, who is free from desire amidst pleasures, and from whom longing, fear, and wrath have departed—he is said to be a firm-minded sage.The sage whose mind is unruffled in suffering, whose desire is not aroused by enjoyment, who is without attachment, anger, or fear—take him to be one who stands at a lofty level.He who has no love on any side, who, upon finding good or evil, neither rejoices nor hates—his wisdom is firmly set.The wisdom of that person remains established who has no attachment to anything anywhere, who neither welcomes nor rejects anything, whatever good or bad, when they come across it.He who is everywhere without attachment, upon encountering anything good or bad, neither rejoices nor hastens; his wisdom is firm.He who has no desire for anything, and who neither rejoices nor hates upon obtaining this or that, good or bad—his intellect is properly stabilized.He who, wherever he goes, is not attached to any person or place by ties of flesh; who accepts good and evil alike, neither welcoming the one nor shrinking from the other—take him to be one who is merged in the Infinite.When one is able to draw their senses away from the objects of sense on all sides, like a tortoise draws in its limbs, then their wisdom is firmly established.And when one fully withdraws their senses from the objects of the senses, just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs, then their wisdom remains established.When, like the tortoise which withdraws all its limbs on all sides, he withdraws his senses from the sense-objects, then his wisdom becomes steady.When he withdraws all his senses from sense-objects, just as a tortoise withdraws all its limbs, then he is declared to be a man of stabilized intellect.He who can withdraw his senses from the attraction of their objects, as the tortoise draws its limbs within its shell—take it that such a one has attained perfection.The objects of the senses, except for the pleasure they bring, turn away from the abstinent dweller in the body. Even the pleasure turns away from him when the Self, which is supreme over the senses, is seen.The objects recede from an abstinent person, except for the taste for them. Even this taste falls away after realization of the Absolute.The objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent man, leaving the longing behind; but his longing also turns away upon seeing the Supreme.Leaving their taste behind, the sense-objects retreat from the embodied one who abstains from food; his taste too disappears when he beholds the Supreme.The objects of sense turn away from him who is abstinent. Even the taste for them is lost in him who has seen the Truth.The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, can forcibly carry away the mind of even a wise man, though he is ever striving.For, O son of Kunti, the turbulent senses can violently snatch away the mind of an intelligent person, even while they are striving diligently.The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, can violently carry away the mind of a wise person, even though they are striving to control them.For, the turbulent sense-organs can forcibly carry away even the mind of this discerning person, O son of Kunti!O Arjuna! The mind of one who is attempting to conquer it is forcibly carried away, in spite of their efforts, by their tumultuous senses.Having controlled all the senses, let him remain in contemplation, regarding Me as supreme; for his knowledge is firmly established when his senses are under control.Controlling all of them, one should remain focused on Me as the supreme. For, the wisdom of one whose senses are under control becomes steadfast.Having restrained them all, he should sit steadfast, intent on Me; his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control.Restraining the same organs by the mind, the master of Yoga would sit, making Me their goal; for the intellect of that person is stabilized whose sense-organs are under control.Restraining them all, let him steadfastly meditate on Me; for whoever conquers their senses achieves perfection.To one who is thinking about sense-objects, attachment to them arises; from attachment arises desire, and from desire arises anger.- In the case of a person who dwells on objects, there arises attachment to them. From attachment grows hankering, and from hankering springs anger.When one thinks of objects, attachment to them arises; from attachment, desire is born; from desire, anger arises.In a person meditating on sense-objects, attachment to them is born in succession; from attachment springs passion; from passion arises wrath.When a person dwells on the objects of sense, they create an attraction for them; this attraction develops into desire, and desire breeds anger.Anger leads to delusion, which causes the loss of memory; the loss of memory leads to the destruction of discrimination, and with the destruction of discrimination, one is lost.From anger follows delusion; from delusion, a failure of memory; from the failure of memory, the loss of understanding; and from the loss of understanding, one perishes.Anger leads to delusion, which causes loss of memory; this, in turn, leads to the destruction of discrimination, resulting in destruction.From wrath comes delusion; from delusion, the loss of memory; from the loss of memory, the loss of capacity to decide; due to the loss of capacity to decide, he perishes outright.Anger induces delusion; delusion leads to loss of memory; loss of memory results in the shattering of reason; and the destruction of reason leads to destruction.But he who goes through the sense-objects with the senses free from love and hate, disciplined and controlled, attains serenity.But by perceiving objects with the organs that are free from attraction and repulsion, and are under his own control, the self-controlled person attains serenity.But the self-controlled man, moving among objects with the senses restrained and free from attraction and repulsion, attains peace.On the contrary, one who moves about and consumes the sense-objects through their sense-organs, freed from desire and hatred and controlled in the Self—such a one, with a disciplined mind, attains serenity of disposition.But the self-controlled soul, who moves among sense objects, free from attachment or repulsion, wins eternal peace.In that serenity, all sorrow is lost; for in the case of the person with a serene mind, the Buddhi is quickly established.When there is serenity, all his sorrows are eradicated, for the wisdom of one with a serene mind soon becomes firmly established.In that peace, all pains are destroyed; for the intellect of the tranquil-minded soon becomes steady.Upon attaining serenity, all miseries are extinguished in succession; the ability to make decisions is quickly stabilized in the mind of one who is serene.Having attained peace, he becomes free from misery; for when the mind gains peace, right discrimination follows.There is no Buddhi for the unintegrated, nor is there contemplation of the self for him, and without contemplation of the self, there is no peace; and for one who lacks peace, where is the happiness?For the unsteady there is no wisdom, and there is no meditation for the unsteady person. And for an unmeditative person there is no peace. How can there be happiness for one without peace?There is no knowledge of the Self for the unsteady, and no meditation is possible for the unsteady, and no peace for the unmeditative, and how can there be happiness for one who has no peace?The ability to make decisions is not for one who is not a master of Yoga; and concentration of the mind is not for one who is not a master of Yoga; and peace is not for one who does not concentrate; whence could happiness come to one who has no peace?Right discrimination is not for him who cannot concentrate. Without concentration, there cannot be meditation; he who cannot meditate must not expect peace; and without peace, how can one expect happiness?For, when the mind follows the senses, experiencing their objects, his understanding is carried away by them, just as the wind carries away a ship on the waters.For, the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses carries away his wisdom like a boat on the waters.For the mind, which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, as the wind carries away a boat on the waters.That mind, which is directed to follow the wandering sense-organs—that mind carries away his knowledge just as the wind carries away a ship on the waters.As a ship at sea is tossed by the tempest, so the reason is carried away by the mind when preyed upon by straying senses.Therefore, O mighty-armed one, he whose senses are restrained from going after their objects on all sides, his wisdom is firmly established.Therefore, O mighty-armed one, this wisdom becomes established when all its senses are withdrawn from their objects.Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained from sense objects.Therefore, O mighty-armed one, the intellect of that person is stabilized, all of whose sense-organs, starting from the sense-objects, have been well restrained.Therefore, O Mighty-Armed One, he whose senses are detached from their objects—take it that his reason is purified.What is night for all beings, in it the one who is controlled is awake; when all beings are awake, that is the night for the sage who sees.The self-restrained man stays awake during what is night for all creatures. That which creatures stay awake for, it is night to the discerning sage.That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man is awake; when all beings are awake, that is night for the sage who sees.What is night for every other being, in that a man of self-restraint is awake; wherein every other being is awake, that is night for the sage who sees the truth.The saint is awake when the world sleeps, and he disregards that for which the world lives.He into whom all desires enter, just as the waters enter the full and undisturbed sea, attains peace, and not he who longs after objects of desire.That man attains peace into whom all desires enter, just as waters flow into the sea that remains unchanged even when filled from all sides. Not so one who is desirous of objects.He attains peace into whom all desires enter, just as waters enter the ocean which, filled from all sides, remains unmoved; but not the man who is full of desires.Just as waters enter into the ocean which is being filled continuously yet firmly established, so too he into whom all objects of desire enter—he attains peace; not he who longs for the objects of desire.He attains peace into whom desires flow as rivers into the ocean, which, though brimming with water, remains ever the same; not he whom desires carry away.The one who, abandoning all desires, abides without longing, possession, and the sense of 'I' and 'mine', wins peace.That man attains peace who, after rejecting all desires, moves about free from hankering, without the idea of 'me' and 'mine', and devoid of pride.That person attains peace who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, without the sense of ownership, and without egoism.That person, who, by abandoning all desires, consumes [objects] without longing, without a sense of ownership, and without egotism, attains peace.He attains peace who, giving up desire, moves through the world without aspiration, possessing nothing that he can call his own and is free from pride.This is the Brahmic state, O Arjuna. No one attaining to this is deluded. By abiding in this state even at the hour of death, one will attain the Self.O Partha, this is the state of being established in Brahman. One does not become deluded after attaining this; one attains identification with Brahman by being established in this state even in the closing years of one's life.O son of Pritha, this is the eternal state, the Brahmic seat. Attaining this, one is not deluded. Being established in it, one attains oneness with Brahman even at the end of life.O son of Prtha! This is the Brahmanic state; having attained this, one never gets deluded again. Even by remaining in this [state] for a while, one attains at the time of death the Brahman, the Transcendent One.O Arjuna! This is the state of the Self, the Supreme Spirit, to which, if one attains, it shall never be taken away. Even at the time of leaving the body, one will remain firmly enthroned there and become one with the Eternal.Arjuna said, "O Krsna, if you deem knowledge to be superior to action, why then do you urge me to engage in this terrible deed?"Arjuna said, "O Janardana (Krishna), if it is Your opinion that wisdom is superior to action, why do You urge me to take such horrible action, O Kesava?"Arjuna said: If Thou thinkest that knowledge is superior to action, O Krishna, why then, O Kesava, doest Thou ask me to engage in this terrible action?Arjuna said, "O Janardana, if you hold knowledge to be superior to action, then why do you engage me in such terrible action, O Kesava?"Arjuna questioned: My Lord! If wisdom is superior to action, why do you advise me to engage in this terrible fight?You confuse my mind with statements that seem to contradict each other; tell me for certain the one way by which I could reach the highest good.You bewilder my understanding, as it were, with a seemingly conflicting statement! Tell me for certain which one of these I may use to attain the highest Good.With this seemingly perplexing speech, you seem to be confusing my understanding; therefore, tell me one certain way by which I may attain bliss.You seem to be confounding my intellect with Your seemingly confusing speech. Therefore, tell me with certainty that one thing by which I may attain the good (emancipation).Your language confuses me and confounds my reason. Therefore, please tell me the only way by which I can, without doubt, secure my spiritual welfare.The Lord said, "In this world, a two-fold way was of yore laid down by Me, O sinless one: Jnana Yoga for the Sankhyas and Karma Yoga for the Yogins."The Blessed Lord said, O unblemished one, two kinds of steadfastness in this world were spoken of by Me in days gone by—through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis.The Blessed Lord said, "In this world, there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one: the path of knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogins."The Bhagavat said, "The two-fold path in this world—the one with Yoga of knowledge for men of reflection and the other with Yoga of action for men of Yoga—has been declared by Me to be one, O sinless one!"Lord Shri Krishna replied: In this world, as I have said, there is a twofold path, O sinless one! There is the path of wisdom for those who meditate, and the path of action for those who work.No one experiences freedom from action (Naiskarmya) by abstaining from work; and no one ever attains success through mere renunciation of work.A person does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from action; nor does he attain fulfillment merely through renunciation.Man does not reach actionlessness by not performing actions; nor does he attain perfection by mere renunciation.A person attains actionlessness not just by abstaining from actions, but also by renunciation, he attains success (emancipation).No one can attain freedom from action by abstaining from action, nor can they reach perfection by simply not acting.No one can remain still for even a moment without doing work; for everyone is compelled to act, despite themselves, by the Gunas born of Nature.For no one ever remains even for a moment without doing work, for all are made to work under compulsion by the gunas born of Nature.Verily, no one can remain for even a moment without performing action; for everyone is made to act helplessly, indeed, by the qualities born of Nature.For, no one can ever remain, even for a moment, as a non-performer of action; because everyone, not being master of themselves, is forced to perform action by the strands born of the Prakriti (Material cause).He cannot remain inactive even for a moment, for the qualities of Nature will compel him to act, whether he wills it or not.He who, controlling the organs of action, lets his mind dwell on the objects of the senses, is a deluded person and a hypocrite.One who, after withdrawing the organs of action, sits mentally recollecting the objects of the senses, is called a hypocrite, for they have a deluded mind.He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in his mind, he of deluded understanding is called a hypocrite.Controlling their organs of action, whoever sits with their mind pondering over sense objects—that person is a man of deluded soul and is called a man of deluded action.He who remains motionless, refusing to act, yet brooding over sensuous objects, is that deluded soul simply a hypocrite.But he who, subduing his senses by the mind, O Arjuna, begins to practice Karma Yoga through the organs of action and who is free from attachment, excels.But, O Arjuna, one who engages in Karma-yoga, controlling the organs of action with the mind and becoming unattached, excels.But whoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels.But, controlling the sense-organs with the mind, whoever undertakes the Yoga of action with the action-senses, he, the detached one, is superior, O Arjuna!But, O Arjuna! All honor to him whose mind controls his senses, for he is thereby beginning to practice Karma-Yoga, the Path of Right Action, keeping himself always unattached.You must perform your obligatory action; for action is superior to non-action (Jñāna Yoga). For a person following non-action, not even the sustenance of the body is possible.You should perform your obligatory duties, for action is superior to inaction. Moreover, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible without action.Perform your bounden duty, for action is superior to inaction, and even the maintenance of the body would not be possible for you through inaction.You must perform the action that has been enjoined upon you. For, action is superior to inaction; and even the maintenance of your body cannot be properly accomplished through inaction.Do your duty as prescribed, for action for duty's sake is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of the body would be impossible if one remained inactive.This world is held in the bondage of work only when work is not performed as a sacrifice. O Arjuna, you must perform work for this purpose, free from attachment.This man becomes bound by actions other than those intended for God. Without being attached, O son of Kunti, perform actions for Him.The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform actions for that sake alone, free from attachment.The world is fettered by action which is different from Yajna-action; therefore, O son of Kunti, free from attachment, perform Yajna-action properly.In this world, people are fettered by their actions, unless they are performed as a sacrifice. Therefore, O Arjuna, let your actions be done without attachment, as a sacrifice only.In the beginning, the Lord of all beings created man along with the sacrifice and said, "By this shall you prosper; this shall be the cow of plenty, granting all your desires."In days of yore, having created the beings together with the sacrifices, Prajapati said, "By this, you shall multiply. Let this be your yielder of coveted objects of desire."The Creator, having in the beginning created mankind together with sacrifice, said, "By this shall you propagate; let this be the milch cow of your desires—the cow that yields all the desired objects."Having created creatures formerly [at the time of creation], together with the necessary action, the Lord of creatures declared: "By means of this, you shall propagate yourselves; and let this be your wish-fulfilling cow."In the beginning, when God created all beings through the sacrifice of Himself, He said to them: "You can procreate through sacrifice, and it shall satisfy all your desires."By this, please the gods, and they will support you. Thus, nourishing each other, you may obtain the highest good.'You nourish the gods with this. Let those gods nourish you in return. By mutually nourishing each other, you shall attain the supreme Good.'With this, nourish the gods, and may the gods nourish you; thus, nourishing each other, you shall attain the highest good.'You should gratify the devas with this, and let the devas gratify you; thus, mutually gratifying each other, you will attain the highest good.'Worship the powers of Nature, and let them nourish you in return; thus, supporting each other, you shall attain your highest welfare.The gods, pleased by the sacrifice, will bestow upon you the enjoyments you desire. He who enjoys the bounty of the gods without giving them anything in return is but a thief.'Being nourished by sacrifices, the gods will indeed give you the coveted enjoyments. He is certainly a thief who enjoys what has been given by them without offering it to them.'The gods, nourished by the sacrifice, will give you the desired objects. So, he who enjoys the objects given by the gods without offering anything in return is indeed a thief.The devas, gratified with necessary action, will grant you the things sacrificed. Therefore, whoever enjoys their gifts without offering them to these devas is surely a thief.For, fed by sacrifice, nature will give you all the enjoyment you desire. But he who enjoys what she gives without returning is, indeed, a thief.Pious people who eat the remnants of sacrifices are freed from all sins, whereas those who are sinful and cook only for their own sake will only incur sin.By partaking in the remnants of sacrifices, they become freed from all sins. But those who are unholy and cook for themselves incur sin.The righteous who eat the remnants of the sacrifice are freed from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food solely for their own sake indeed consume sin.The righteous persons, who eat the remnants of the actions to be performed necessarily, are freed from all sins. But those who cook, intending for their own selves, are sinners and consume sin.The sages who enjoy the food that remains after the sacrifice is made are freed from all sins; whereas, the selfish who spread their feast only for themselves feed on sin alone.All beings arise from food; food is produced from rain; rain comes from sacrifice; and sacrifice is born of action.From food are born the creatures; the origin of food is from rain; rain originates from sacrifice; sacrifice has action as its source.From food come forth beings; from rain, food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain, and sacrifice is born of action.From food arise the things that are born; from the rain-cloud the food arises; from the sacrifice the rain-cloud arises; the sacrifice arises from action.All creatures are the product of food; food is the product of rain; rain comes from sacrifice, and sacrifice is the noblest form of action.Know that activity springs from Brahman, i.e., the physical body; Brahman arises from the imperishable Self; therefore, the all-pervading Brahman is ever established in sacrifice.Know that action has the Vedas as its origin; the Vedas have the Immutable as their source. Hence, the all-pervading Vedas are forever based on sacrifice.Know that action comes from Brahma, and Brahma comes from the Imperishable. Therefore, the all-pervasive Brahma ever rests in sacrifice.Action arises from the Brahman; you should know this; the Brahman arises from that which does not stream forth; therefore, the all-pervading Brahman is permanently based on the sacrifice.All actions originate from the Supreme Spirit, which is Imperishable, and in sacrificial actions, the all-pervasive Spirit is consciously present.He who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion here, lives in sin, satisfying the senses, O Arjuna; he lives in vain.O Partha, he who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion lives in vain, their life is sinful, and they indulge in the senses.He who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, lives in vain, O Arjuna.Whoever does not keep the wheel of life rolling, which has been set in motion in this world, is a man of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses; and he lives in vain, O son of Prtha!Thus, he who does not help the revolving wheel of sacrifice, but instead leads a sinful life, rejoicing in the gratification of his senses, O Arjuna, is breathing in vain.But the man whose delight is only in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self, who rejoices in the Self, for him nothing remains to be accomplished.But that man who rejoices only in the Self, is satisfied with the Self, and is content only in the Self—for him there is no duty to perform.But for that man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self and is content in the Self alone, indeed there is nothing to do.But the man who simply rejoices in the Self, is satisfied in the Self, and delights in the Self alone—there exists no action for him to be performed.On the other hand, the soul who meditates on the Self is content to serve the Self and rests satisfied in the Self; there is nothing more for them to accomplish.He has no purpose to gain from work done or left undone, nor does he have to rely on any end.For him, there is no concern here at all with performing action, nor any with non-performance. Moreover, he has no dependence on any object to serve any purpose.For him, there is no interest whatsoever in what is done or not done; nor does he depend on any being for any purpose.No purpose is served for him by what he has done or by what he has not done. For him, there is hardly any dependence on any purpose among all beings.He has nothing to gain from the performance or non-performance of action; his welfare does not depend on any contribution that an earthly creature can make.Therefore, do your work without attachment, which ought to be done. For, a person who works without attachment attains the Supreme.Therefore, remaining unattached, always perform the obligatory duty; for, by performing one's duty without attachment, a person attains the highest.Therefore, without attachment, always perform the actions that should be done; for by performing actions without attachment, one reaches the Supreme.Therefore, always remaining unattached, you should perform the action that is to be performed; for, the person performing action without attachment attains the Supreme.Therefore, do your duty perfectly, without worrying about the results, for he who does his duty without attachment attains the Supreme.Indeed, Janaka and others reached perfection through Karma Yoga alone. Even recognizing its necessity for guiding the world, you must perform action.For Janaka and others strove to attain liberation through action itself. You should perform your duties, keeping in view the prevention of mankind from going astray.Janaka and others attained perfection indeed through action alone; even with the intention of protecting the masses, you should perform action.Janaka and others attained emancipation through action alone. Moreover, you should act with the intention of upholding the world.King Janaka and others attained perfection through action alone. Even for the sake of enlightening the world, it is your duty to act.Whatever a great man does, others do too. Whatever standard he sets, the world follows it.Whatever a superior person does, another person does the same! Whatever they uphold as authority, an ordinary person follows that.Whatever a great man does, others also do; whatever he establishes as the standard, the world follows.Whatever a great man does, others of lesser stature follow suit; whatever standard he sets, the world follows it.For whatever a great man does, others imitate; people conform to the standard he has set.For me, Arjuna, there is nothing in all the three worlds that ought to be done, nor is there anything unaccomplished that ought to be accomplished. Yet I continue to work.In all the three worlds, O Partha, there is no duty for Me to fulfill; nothing remains unachieved or to be achieved. (Still,) I continue in action.There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that needs to be done by Me, nor is there anything unattained that needs to be attained; yet I engage Myself in action.O son of Prtha! For Me, there is nothing to be done in the three worlds, nor is there anything yet to be attained; and yet I am engaged in action.There is nothing in this universe, O Arjuna, that I am compelled to do, nor anything for me to attain; yet I persistently remain active.If I did not continue to work unweariedly, O Arjuna, people would follow my path.For, O Partha, if at any time I do not continue vigilantly in action, people will follow My path in every way.For, should I not ever engage myself in action, unwearied, people would in every way follow my path, O Arjuna.For, if I were ever not to work unwearied, all men would follow My path, O son of Prtha!Were I not to act without ceasing, O prince, people would be inclined to do the same.If I do not do the work, these people will be lost; and I will be causing chaos in life and thereby ruining all these people.These worlds would be ruined if I did not perform action. And I shall become the agent of intermingling (of castes), and shall be destroying these beings.These worlds would perish if I did not perform action; I would be the author of confusion of castes and destruction of these beings.These worlds would perish if I were not to perform action; and I would be the cause of confusion; I would destroy these people.And if I were to refrain from action, the human race would be ruined; I would lead the world to chaos, and destruction would follow.Just as the ignorant, attached to their work, act, O Arjuna, so too the learned should act without any attachment, and only for the welfare of the world.O scion of the Bharata dynasty, as the unenlightened people act with attachment to work, so should the enlightened person act, without attachment, desiring to prevent people from going astray.As the ignorant act out of attachment to action, O Bharata, so should the wise act without attachment, wishing for the welfare of the world.Therefore, just as the unwise persons, being attached to action, do, O son of Prtha, so the wise should perform, but being unattached and desiring to hold the world together.As the ignorant act, out of their fondness for action, so should the wise act without attachment, fixing their eyes, O Arjuna, only on the welfare of the world.He should not bewilder the minds of the ignorant who are attached to work; rather, he should himself perform work with devotion and cause others to do the same.The enlightened man should not disturb the beliefs of the ignorant, who are attached to work. He should remain diligent himself and make them perform all their duties.Let no wise man unsettle the minds of ignorant people who are attached to action; he should engage them in all actions, himself fulfilling them with devotion.Let the wise master of Yoga fulfill (or destroy) all actions by performing them all, and let him not create any disturbance in the minds of the ignorant persons attached to action.But a wise man should not disturb the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to action; let him perform his own actions in the right spirit, with concentration on Me, thus inspiring all others to do the same.Actions are being performed in every way by the Gunas of Prakrti; he whose nature is deluded by egoism, however, thinks, 'I am the doer.'While actions are being done in every way by the gunas (qualities) of Nature, one who is deluded by egoism thinks, "I am the doer."All actions are wrought in all cases by the qualities of Nature alone. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks, "I am the doer."The actions are performed part by part by the strands of Prakriti; yet, the person, having his self (mind) deluded with egoity, imagines, 'I am the sole doer.'Action is the product of the qualities inherent in nature. It is only the ignorant man who, misled by personal egotism, says, "I am the doer."But he who knows the truth about the division of the Gunas and works, O mighty-armed one, through his knowledge that the Gunas 'operate on their own products,' is not attached.But, O mighty-armed one, the one who is a knower of the facts about the varieties of the gunas and actions does not become attached, thinking thus: 'The organs act on the objects of the organs.'But he who knows the Truth, O mighty-armed Arjuna, about the divisions of the qualities and their functions, knowing that the Gunas, as senses, move amidst the Gunas, as the sense-objects, is not attached.But, O mighty-armed one, the one who knows the true nature of the strands and their respective divisions of work, realizes: 'The strands are in their respective purposes.' And thus, he is not attached.But he, O Mighty One, who correctly understands the relationship between the Qualities and action, is not attached to the act, for he perceives that it is merely the action and reaction of the Qualities among themselves.Those who are deluded by the Gunas of Prakrti are attached to the works of the Gunas. But he who knows the whole truth should not disturb the ignorant who do not know the whole truth.Those who are completely deluded by the gunas of Nature become attached to the activities of the gunas. The one who knows the All should not disturb those of dull intellect, who do not know the All.Those deluded by the qualities of Nature are attached to the functions of the qualities. The man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one who is of imperfect knowledge.Men, completely deluded by the strands of Prakrti, are attached to the actions of those strands. Those who know fully should not confuse them, whereas the dullards who do not know fully.Those who do not understand the qualities are interested in the act; however, the wise man who knows the truth should not disturb the mind of those who do not.Surrender all your actions to Me, with a mind focused on the Self, free from desire and selfishness, and fight with the heat of excitement abated.Free from the fever of the soul, dedicate all actions to Me, with your mind intent on the Self, and become free from expectations and egoism, and engage in battle.Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centered on the Self, free from hope and egoism, and from mental fever, fight thou.Renouncing all actions in Me, with a mind that concentrates on the Self; being free from the act of resting and from the sense of possession; and consequently being free from mental fever; you should fight.Therefore, surrender your actions to Me, keep your thoughts focused on the Absolute, free from selfishness and without expecting a reward, with a mind free from excitement, begin to fight.Those men who, full of faith, ever practice this teaching of Mine and those who receive it without cavil—even they are released from karma.Those who faithfully follow this teaching of Mine without cavil, they too become freed from their actions.Those who constantly practice this teaching of Mine with faith and without caviling, they too are freed from actions.Those who constantly follow this doctrine of Mine, with faith and without finding fault, are freed from the results of all actions.Those who always act in accordance with My precepts, firmly in faith and without caviling, they too are freed from the bondage of action.But those who slander it, and those who do not practice this teaching of Mine—know them to be utterly senseless and devoid of all knowledge, and thus lost.But those who, finding fault where there is none, do not follow My teaching, know them—who are deluded about all knowledge concerning the qualified and the unqualified Brahman and who are devoid of discrimination—to have gone to ruin.But those who criticize My teaching and do not practice it, deprived of all knowledge and lacking discernment, know them to be doomed to destruction.But those who, finding fault, do not follow this doctrine of Mine - be sure that these men are highly deluded in all branches of knowledge and are lost and brainless.But they who ridicule My word and do not observe it, are ignorant, devoid of wisdom, and blind. They seek only their own destruction.Even the man of knowledge acts according to his nature; all beings follow their own nature. What will repression accomplish?Even a man of wisdom behaves according to his own nature. They follow their nature. What can restraint do?Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature; beings will follow their nature; what can restraint do?Even a man of knowledge acts in accordance with his own Prakriti; the elements return to Prakriti; what will restraint avail?Even the wise man acts in accordance with his nature; indeed, all creatures act according to their natures. What is the use of compulsion then?Each sense has a fixed attachment to and aversion for its corresponding object, but one should not come under their sway, for they are enemies.Attraction and repulsion are ordained with respect to the objects of all the organs. One should not be swayed by these two, as they are adversaries.Attachment and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses; let no one come under their sway; for, they are his enemies.For a man of worldly life, there are clearly fixed likes and dislikes with regard to the objects of each of his sense organs. These are the obstacles for him; the wise would not come under their control.The love and hate that are aroused by the objects of sense arise from Nature; do not yield to them, as they only obstruct the path.Better is one's own duty, even if done poorly, than the duty of another done well. It is better to die while performing one's own duty; the duty of another is full of fear.One's own duty, though defective, is superior to another's duty well-performed. Death is better while engaged in one's own duty; another's duty is full of fear.Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit, than the duty of another well discharged. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear.Better is one's own duty, even if it lacks merit, than the well-performed duty of another; it is better to suffer ruin in one's own duty than to gain success in another's.It is better to do one's own duty, however lacking in merit, than to do that of another, even though efficiently. It is better to die doing one's own duty, for doing the duty of another is fraught with danger.Arjuna said, "But, O Krsna, what impels one to commit sin, even against their own will, as if constrained by force?"Arjuna said, "Now then, O scion of the Vrsni dynasty (Krsna), what compels this man to commit sin even against his will, as if he were constrained by force?"Arjuna said, "But what compels man to commit sin, even against his wishes, O Varshneya (Krishna), as if constrained by force?"Arjuna said, "Then, what induces this person of the world to commit sin, even though they do not desire it, as if they are being overpowered by a force?"Arjuna asked, "My Lord, what is it that drives a person to sin, even against their will and as if by compulsion?"The Lord said, "It is desire, it is wrath, born of the guna of rajas; it is a great devourer, an impeller of sin. Know this to be the enemy here."The Blessed Lord said, "This desire, this anger, born of the quality of rajas, is a great devourer, a great source of sin. Know this to be the enemy here."The Blessed Lord said, "It is desire and it is anger, both of the quality of Rajas, all-devouring and all-sinful; know this as the foe here in this world."The Bhagavat said, "This desire, this wrath, born of the Rajas-strand, is a swallower of festivity and a mighty bestower of sins. Know this to be the enemy here."Lord Shri Krishna: It is desire, it is aversion, born of passion. Desire consumes and corrupts all things. It is the greatest enemy of man.As a fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, and as an embryo is encased in the amniotic sac, so is this world enveloped by desire.As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror is obscured by dirt, and as a fetus remains enclosed in the womb, so is this shrouded by that.As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, and as an embryo is surrounded by the amniotic sac, so is this enveloped by that.As fire is concealed by smoke, a mirror by dirt, and an embryo by its membrane-cover, so He is concealed by this foe.As fire is shrouded by smoke, a mirror is covered by dust, and a child is enveloped by the womb, so is the universe enveloped in desire.The knowledge of the intelligent self is enveloped by this constant enemy, O Arjuna, which is of the nature of desire and is difficult to gratify and insatiable.O son of Kunti, knowledge is covered by this constant enemy of the wise, in the form of desire, which is an insatiable fire.O Arjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise, in the form of desire, which is insatiable like fire.O son of Kunti! The knowledge of the wise is concealed by this eternal foe, which appears desirable yet is insatiable like fire.It is the wise man's constant enemy; it tarnishes the face of wisdom, being as insatiable as a flame of fire.The senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be its instruments; by these, it overpowers the embodied self, enveloping its knowledge.The organs, mind, and intellect are said to be its abode. This one diversely deludes the embodied being, veiling Knowledge with the help of these.The senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be its seat; through these, it deludes the embodied one, veiling their wisdom.It is said to be based on the sense-organs, the mind, and the intellect. With these, it deludes the embodied by concealing knowledge.It works through the senses, the mind, and the reason; and with their help, it destroys wisdom and confounds the soul.Therefore, O Arjuna, control your senses from the outset and slay this sinful thing that destroys both knowledge and discernment.Therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, after first controlling the organs, completely renounce this one which is sinful and a destroyer of learning and wisdom.Therefore, O best of the Bharatas, control your senses first and then kill this sinful thing, which destroys knowledge and realization.Therefore, O best among the Bharatas, you must avoid this sinful one, destroying knowledge and action, by controlling completely the sense-organs in the beginning itself.Therefore, O Arjuna, first control your senses and then slay desire, for it is full of sin and is the destroyer of knowledge and wisdom.They say that the senses are high, the mind is higher than the senses, the intellect is higher than the mind, but what is greater than the intellect is that (desire).They say that the organs are superior to the gross body; the mind is superior to the organs; and the intellect is superior to the mind. However, He is superior to the intellect.They say that the senses are superior to the body; the mind is superior to the senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and He (the Self) is superior even to the intellect.It is said that the sense-organs are different from their objects; the mind is different from the sense-organs; the intellect is different from the mind; and That (Self) is different from the intellect.It is said that the senses are powerful; however, beyond the senses is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, and greater than the intellect is He.Thus, knowing that which is higher than the intellect and fixing the mind with the help of the intellect in Karma Yoga, O Arjuna, slay this enemy which takes the form of desire, and which is difficult to overcome.[The Ast, introduces this verse with, 'Tatah kim, what follows from that?'-Tr.] Understanding the Self thus as superior to the intellect, and completely establishing (the Self) through spiritual absorption with the (help of) the mind, O mighty-armed one, the enemy in the form of desire, which is difficult to subdue, vanishes.Thus, knowing Him who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to conquer.Thus, being conscious that it is different from the intellect, and steadying the self with the self, kill the foe that is of the form of desire and that is hard to approach.Thus, O Mighty-Armed One, knowing Him to be beyond the intellect, and with His help, subdue your personal ego and kill your enemy, Desire, even though it is extremely difficult.The Lord said, "I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; Vivasvan taught it to Manu; Manu declared it to Iksvaku."The Blessed Lord said, "I imparted this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan, who then taught it to Manu, who in turn transmitted it to Iksavaku.The Blessed Lord said, "I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he then told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to Ikshvaku.The Bhagavad said, "This changeless Yoga I had properly taught thus to Vivasvat; Vivasvat correctly told it to Manu; and Manu declared it to Iksvaku."Lord Shri Krishna said: I taught this imperishable philosophy to Vivaswān, the founder of the Sun dynasty; Vivaswān gave it to Manu, the lawgiver, and Manu to King Ikshvāku.Thus handed down in succession, the royal sages knew this (Karma Yoga). But with a long lapse of time, O Arjuna, that Yoga was lost to the world.The king-sages knew this yoga, which was received in regular succession. That yoga, O destroyer of foes, is now lost due to a long lapse of time.This, handed down in regular succession by the royal sages, was known. This Yoga, however, has been lost here over time, O Parantapa (burner of the foes).Thus, the regal sages knew this, which was received in regular succession. Over time, however, this Yoga has been lost, O scorcher of enemies!The Divine Kings knew it, for it was their tradition; then, after a long time, it was at last forgotten.It is the same ancient Yoga that I am now teaching you, for you are My devotee and My friend. For, this is a supreme mystery.That ancient Yoga itself, which is this, has been taught to you by Me today, considering you to be My devotee and friend, for this Yoga is a profound secret.That same ancient yoga has been today taught to you by me, for you are my devotee and my friend; it is the supreme secret.The same ancient Yoga has now been taught to you by Me, on the grounds that you are both My devotee and friend. This is the highest secret.It is the same ancient path that I have now revealed to you, for you are my devotee and my friend. It is the supreme secret.Arjuna said, "Your birth was later, and Vivasvan's birth was earlier. How then can I understand that you taught it in the beginning?"Arjuna said, "Your birth was later, whereas Vivasvan's birth was earlier. How am I to understand that You instructed him in the beginning?"Arjuna said, "Later was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun); how am I to understand that Thou hast taught this Yoga from the beginning?"Arjuna said, "Your birth is later, while the birth of Vivasvat is earlier; how am I then to understand that You had properly taught him this in the beginning?"Arjuna asked: My Lord! Vyasawana was born before You; how then can You have revealed it to him?The Lord said, "Many of My births have passed, O Arjuna, as have yours. I know them all, but you do not know them."The Blessed Lord said, "O Arjuna, many lives of Mine have passed, and so have yours. I know them all, but you do not know, O scorcher of enemies!"The Blessed Lord said, "Many births of Mine have passed, as well as of thine, O Arjuna; I know them all, but thou knowest not, O Parantapa (scorcher of foes)."The Bhagavat said, "O Arjuna, many births of Mine as well as yours have passed. All of them I know, but you do not, O scorcher of foes!"Lord Shri Krishna replied: I have been born again and again, from time to time; thou too, O Arjuna! My births are known to me, but yours are unknown to you.Though I am birthless and of immutable nature, and the Lord of all beings, yet by employing My own Nature (Prakrti), I am born out of My own free will.Though I am birthless and undecaying by nature, and the Lord of beings, yet by subjugating My Prakriti, I take birth through My own Maya.Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, governing my own nature, I am born by my own Maya.Though I am unborn and changeless Self, though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, presiding over My own nature, I take birth by My own trick of illusion.There is no beginning to Me. Though I am imperishable and the Lord of all that exists, I manifest Myself by My own will and power.Whenever there is a decline of Dharma, O Arjuna, and an uprising of Adharma, then I incarnate myself.O scion of the Bharata dynasty, whenever there is a decline in virtue and an increase in vice, then I manifest Myself.Whenever there is a decline of righteousness and an increase of unrighteousness, O Arjuna, then I manifest Myself.For, whenever there is a decay of righteousness and the rise of unrighteousness, then, O descendant of Bharata, I send forth that which the Self is unimportant.Whenever spirituality decays and materialism is rampant, then, O Arjuna, I reincarnate myself.For the protection of the good and the destruction of the wicked, for the establishment of Dharma, I am born from age to age.For the protection of the pious, the destruction of the evil-doers, and the establishment of virtue, I manifest myself in every age.For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of righteousness, I am born in every age.For the protection of the good people, and for the destruction of evildoers, and for the purpose of firmly establishing righteousness, I take birth in every age.To protect the righteous, to destroy the wicked, and to establish the kingdom of God, I am reborn from age to age.He who thus knows in truth My divine birth and actions does not get rebirth after leaving the body; he will come to Me, O Arjuna.He who thus knows truly the divine birth and actions of Mine does not get rebirth after casting off the body. He attains Me, O Arjuna.He who thus knows, in their true light, My divine birth and actions, having abandoned the body, is not born again; he comes to Me, O Arjuna.Whoever knows correctly the divine birth and action of Mine, he, upon abandoning the body, does not go to rebirth, but goes to Me, O Arjuna!He who realizes the divine truth concerning My birth and life does not take birth again; and when he leaves his body, he becomes one with Me.Freed from desire, fear, and wrath, absorbed in Me, depending upon Me, purified by the austerity of knowledge, many have attained My state.Many who were devoid of attachment, fear, and anger, who were absorbed in Me, who had taken refuge in Me, and were purified by the austerity of knowledge, have attained My state.Freed from attachment, fear, and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of knowledge, many have attained My Being.Many persons, who are free from passion, fear, and anger; are full of Me; take refuge in Me; and have become pure through the austerity of wisdom—they have come to My being.Many have merged their existences in Mine, being freed from desire, fear, and anger, always filled with Me and purified by the illuminating flame of self-abnegation.Whoever resorts to Me in any manner, I favor them in the same manner; men experience Me alone in different ways, O Arjuna.According to the manner in which they approach Me, I favor them in that same manner. O son of Partha, humans follow My path in every way.In whatever way men approach Me, even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in all ways, O Arjuna.The way in which people resort to Me, in the same way I favor them. O son of Prtha, all kinds of people follow My path.However men try to worship Me, I welcome them. Whatever path they take, it leads to Me in the end.Those who desire the fruits of their ritualistic acts, sacrifice to the gods here; for, success quickly accrues in the world of men.Longing for the fruition of their actions (of their rites and duties), they worship the gods here. For, in the human world, success from action comes quickly.Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods; for success is quickly attained by men through action.Those who desire success in their actions perform sacrifices, intending them for the deities. For, the success born of ritualistic actions is quick in the world of men.Those who seek success worship the Powers, and their actions in this world bear immediate fruit.The system of four stations was created by Me, according to the distinction of Gunas and Karma. Though I am their creator, know Me to be non-agent and immutable.The four castes have been created by Me through a classification of the gunas and duties. Even though I am the agent of that (act of classification), still know Me to be non-agentive and changeless.The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma; though I am the author of it, know Me as non-doer and immutable.I have created the four-fold caste structure according to the division of their respective qualities and actions. Though I am the creator of this, know Me as the changeless, non-creator.The four divisions of society—the wise, the soldier, the merchant, and the laborer—were created by Me, according to the natural distribution of qualities and instincts. I am the author of them, though I Myself do not act and am changeless.Works cannot contaminate Me. There is no desire for the fruits of actions in Me. He who understands this is not bound by actions.Actions do not taint Me; for I have no hankering for the results of actions. One who knows Me thus, does not become bound by their actions.Actions do not taint Me, nor do I have a desire for the fruit of actions. He who knows Me thus is not bound by actions.Actions do not stain me, nor do I have a desire for the fruits of them either. Whoever understands me in this way is not bound by their actions.My actions do not bind Me, nor do I desire anything that they can bring. He who thus realizes Me is not enslaved by action.Knowing thus, even ancient seekers of liberation did their work. Therefore, do your work only as the ancients did in olden times.Thus having known, even the ancient seekers of liberation performed their duties. Therefore, you should undertake action as was performed earlier by the ancients.Having known this, the ancient seekers of freedom also performed action; therefore, do thou also perform action, as the ancients did in days of yore.Realizing in this fashion, ancient seekers of salvation also undertook action. Hence, you too should, by all means, perform the action that was performed by the ancients.In the light of wisdom, our ancestors who sought deliverance performed their acts. Act thou also as our fathers of old did.What is action? What is non-action? Even the wise are puzzled in respect of these. I shall declare to you that kind of action, knowing which you will be freed from evil.Even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction. I shall tell you of that action, knowing which you will become free from evil.What is action? What is inaction? Even the wise are confused about this. Therefore, I shall teach you the nature of action and inaction, by knowing which you will be liberated from the evil of Samsara, the wheel of birth and death.Even the wise are perplexed about what is action and what is non-action; I shall properly teach you the action, by knowing which you will be freed from evil.What is action and what is inaction? This is a question that has bewildered the wise. But I will declare to you the philosophy of action, and knowing it, you will be free from evil.For, there is what ought to be known in action; likewise, there is what ought to be known in multi-form action; and there is what ought to be understood in non-action. Thus, mysterious is the way of action.For there is something to be known even about action, and something to be known about prohibited action; and something needs to be known about inaction. The true nature of action is inscrutable.For verily, the true nature of action enjoined by the scriptures should be known, as well as that of forbidden or unlawful action, and of inaction; the nature of action is hard to understand.Something has to be understood about good action; something has to be understood about wrong action; and something has to be understood about non-action. It is difficult to comprehend the way of action.It is necessary to consider what is right action, what is wrong action, and what is inaction, for the law of action is mysterious.He who sees inaction in action and also action in inaction is wise among men. He is fit for release and has accomplished all actions.He who finds inaction in action, and action in inaction, is the wise one [possessed of the knowledge of Brahman] among men; they are engaged in yoga and are performers of all actions!He who sees inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men; he is a yogi and performer of all actions.He who finds non-action in action, and action in non-action, is an intelligent one among men and is said to be a performer or destroyer of all actions.He who can see inaction in action, and action in inaction, is the wisest among men. He is a saint, even though he still acts.He whose every undertaking is free from desire and delusive identification (of the body with the self), whose actions are burned up in the fire of knowledge—the wise describe him as a sage.The wise call him learned whose actions are all devoid of desires and their thoughts, and whose actions have been burned away by the fire of wisdom.He whose undertakings are all devoid of desires and selfish purposes, and whose actions have been burned by the fire of knowledge, the wise call him a sage.He whose every exertion is devoid of intention for desirable objects, and whose actions are burnt up by the fire of wisdom—the wise call such a person a man of learning.The wise call him a sage, for whatever he undertakes is free from the motive of desire, and his deeds are purified by the fire of wisdom.Having renounced attachment to the fruits of their actions, ever contented with the eternal self, and dependent on none, one does not act at all, even while being engaged in action.Having given up attachment to the results of action, he who is ever-content, dependent on nothing, does not really do anything even though he is engaged in action.Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of the action, ever content, depending on nothing, he does not do anything even while being engaged in activity.By abandoning attachment to the fruits of actions, remaining ever content and depending on nothing, that person, even though they are engaged in action, does not perform anything at all.Having surrendered all claim to the results of his actions, he is always contented and independent; in reality, he does nothing, even though he appears to be acting.Free from desire, his intellect and mind controlled, having given up all possessions, and doing bodily work only, he is not subject to evil.One who is without solicitation, who has the mind and senses under control, and is totally without possessions, incurs no sin by performing actions merely for the maintenance of the body.Without hope, controlling the mind and the self, having abandoned all covetousness, and performing only bodily actions, one incurs no sin.Having rid of cravings, controlling the mind and body, abandoning all sense of possession, and performing actions with the body alone, one does not incur any sin.Expecting nothing, his mind and personality controlled, without greed, doing only bodily actions; though he acts, he remains untainted.Content with what chance may bring, rising above the pairs of opposites, free from ill-will, even-minded in success and failure, he acts, yet is not bound.Remaining satisfied with what comes unasked for, having transcended the dualities, being free from spite, and balanced under success and failure, he is not bound even by performing actions.Content with what comes to him without effort, free from the pairs of opposites and envy, even-minded in success and failure, he acts yet is not bound.Remaining content with the gain brought by chance, transcending the dualities (pairs of opposites), entertaining no jealousy, and remaining equal in success and in failure, he does not get bound, even when he acts.Content with what comes to him without any effort of his own, rising above the pairs of opposites, free from envy, his mind balanced in both success and failure; though he acts, the consequences do not bind him.One whose attachments have been relinquished, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, and who works only for sacrifices—their Karma is entirely dissolved.The liberated person, who has rid themselves of attachment and whose mind is fixed in knowledge, has their actions undertaken for a sacrifice completely destroyed.To one who is devoid of attachment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, and who works for the sake of sacrifice (for the sake of God), the whole action is dissolved.The action is completely dissolved in the case of the person who undertakes it for the sake of sacrifice; who is free from attachment and has been liberated; and whose mind is fixed in wisdom.He who is without attachment, free, his mind centered in wisdom, and his actions done as a sacrifice, leave no trace behind.Brahman is the instrument with which to offer; Brahman is the oblation. By Brahman is the oblation offered into the fire of Brahman; Brahman alone is to be attained by one who meditates on Him in their works.The ladle is Brahman, the oblations are Brahman, and the offering is poured by Brahman into the fire of Brahman. He who has concentration on Brahman as the objective can only reach Brahman.Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter (ghee); by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman indeed shall be attained by one who always sees Brahman in action.The Brahman-oblation that is to be offered to the Brahman is poured into the Brahman-fire by the Brahman; it is nothing but the Brahman that is to be attained by one whose deep contemplation is the Brahman-action.For him, the sacrifice is the Spirit; the Spirit and the offering are one; it is the Spirit that is sacrificed in its own fire, and the man, even in action, is united with God, since his mind never ceases to be fixed on Him while performing the act.Some yogis resort only to the sacrifice relating to gods; others offer sacrifice into the fire of Brahman solely through sacrifice.Other yogis undertake sacrifice to gods alone, while others offer the Self as a sacrifice by themselves, in the fire of Brahman.Some yogis perform sacrifice to the gods alone; while others, who have realized the Self, offer the Self as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman alone.Certain other men of Yoga are completely devoted to yajna, connected with the devas, and offer that yajna, simply as a yajna, into the insatiable fire of the Brahman.Some sages sacrifice to the powers, while others offer themselves on the altar of the eternal.Others offer as oblations hearing and other senses into the fires of restraint. Some others offer as oblations the objects of the senses, such as sound and the rest, into the fires of their senses.Others offer their organs, such as their ears, etc., in the fires of self-control. Others offer the objects, such as sound, etc., in the fires of their organs.Some again offer the organ of hearing and other senses as a sacrifice in the fire of restraint; others offer sound and other objects of the senses as a sacrifice in the fire of the senses.Others offer their sense-organs such as the sense of hearing and the rest into the fires of restraint; others offer objects such as sound and the rest into the fires of their sense-organs.Some sacrifice their physical senses in the fire of self-control; others offer up their contact with external objects in the sacrificial fire of their senses.Some again offer as an oblation the functions of the senses and the activity of the vital breaths into the fire of the Yoga of restraint of the mind, kindled by knowledge.Others offer all the activities of the organs and the activities of the vital force into the fire of the yoga of self-control, lit by Knowledge.Others again sacrifice all the functions of the senses and those of the breath (vital energy, or Prana) in the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint, kindled by knowledge.Some others offer all the actions of their sense-organs and the actions of their life-breath into the fire of the Yoga of self-control, ignited by wisdom.Others again sacrifice their activities and vitality in the spiritual fire of self-abnegation, kindled by wisdom.Self-controlled and firm of resolve, others perform the sacrifice of material objects or austerities or yoga; while others offer their scriptural study and knowledge.Similarly, others are performers of sacrifices through wealth, through austerity, through yoga, and through study and knowledge; others are ascetics with severe vows.Others again offer wealth, austerity, and Yoga as sacrifice, while ascetics of self-restraint and rigid vows offer the study of scriptures and knowledge as sacrifice.These are the performers of sacrifices with material objects, the performers of sacrifices with penance, and the performers of sacrifices with Yoga. Likewise, there are other ascetics with rigid vows whose sacrifices are the svadhyaya-knowledge.Others offer as their sacrifice wealth, austerities, and meditation. Monks, wedded to their vows, renounce their scriptural learning and even their spiritual powers.Others, with restricted diets, are devoted to the control of breath. Some sacrifice the inward breath in the outward breath; similarly, others sacrifice the outward breath in the inward breath. Some others, stopping the flow of both the inward and outward breaths, sacrifice the inward and outward breaths.Constantly practicing control of the vital forces by stopping the movements of the outgoing and incoming breaths, some offer as a sacrifice the outgoing breath into the incoming breath; while still others, the incoming breath into the outgoing breath.Others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath into the incoming, and the incoming into the outgoing, restraining the flow of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the restraint of the breath.Some sages offer the prana into the apana; likewise, others offer the apana into the prana. Having controlled both the courses of the prana and apana, the same sages, with their desires fulfilled by the above activities, and with their food restricted, offer the pranas into pranas. All these persons know what sacrifices are and have their sins destroyed by them.There are some who practice controlling the vital energy and governing the subtle forces of prana and apana, thereby sacrificing their prana to apana, or their apana to prana.All these know the meaning of sacrifices, and through sacrifices, their sins are eradicated. Those who subsist on the ambrosial food, the remnants of sacrifices, go to eternal Brahman.Others, having their food regulated, offer the vital forces in the vital forces. All of them are knowers of the sacrifice and have their sins destroyed by the sacrifice.Others who regulate their diet offer life-breaths in each life-breath. All these are knowers of sacrifice, whose sins are destroyed through sacrifice.- . [Some sages] offer the prana into the apana; likewise, others offer the apana into the prana. Having controlled both the courses of the prana and apana, the same sages, with their desires fulfilled by the above activities, and with their food restricted, offer the pranas into pranas. All these persons know what sacrifices are and have their sins destroyed by them.Others, controlling their diet, sacrifice their worldly life to the spiritual fire. All understand the principle of sacrifice, and by it their sins are washed away.This world is not for one who makes no sacrifice; how then for the other, O Arjuna?Those who partake of the nectar left over after a sacrifice reach the eternal Brahman. This world ceases to exist for one who does not perform sacrifices; what, then, to speak of the other world, O best among the Kurus (Arjuna)!Those who eat the remnants of the sacrifice, which are like nectar, go to the eternal Brahman. This world is not for the one who does not perform sacrifice; how then can they have the other, O Arjuna?The eaters of the sacrifice-ordained nectar attain the eternal Brahman. This world is not for a non-sacrificer; how can there be the other? O best of the Kurus!Tasting the nectar of immortality, as the reward of sacrifice, they reach the Eternal. This world is not for those who refuse to sacrifice; nor is the other world.Thus, many forms of sacrifices have been spread out as means of reaching Brahman (individual self in its own nature). Know that all of these are born of actions. Knowing thus, you will be free.Thus, various kinds of sacrifices are spread at the mouth of the Vedas. Know them all to be born of action. Knowing this, you will become liberated.Thus, manifold sacrifices are spread out before Brahman at the face of Brahman. Know them all to be born of action, and thus knowing, you shall be liberated.Thus, sacrifices of many varieties have been elaborated upon by the mouth of the Brahman. Know them all as having sprung from actions. By knowing thus, you shall be liberated.In this way, other sacrifices may also be undertaken for the sake of the Spirit. Know that they all depend on action. Knowing this, you will be free.The sacrifice of knowledge is superior to material sacrifice. O Arjuna, all actions and everything else culminate in knowledge.O destroyer of enemies, knowledge considered as a sacrifice is greater than sacrifices requiring materials. O son of Prtha, all actions in their totality culminate in knowledge.Superior is wisdom-sacrifice to the sacrifice with objects, O Parantapa (scorcher of the foes). All actions in their entirety, O Arjuna, culminate in knowledge.The sacrifice of knowledge is superior to the sacrifice of material things. O son of Prtha, destroyer of enemies! All actions, leaving nothing behind, come to an end in knowledge.The sacrifice of wisdom is superior to any material sacrifice, for, O Arjuna, the pinnacle of action is always realization.Know this through prostration, questioning, and service. The wise who have realized the truth will instruct you in knowledge.Know that the wise ones who have realized the Truth will impart the Knowledge to you through prostration, inquiry, and service.Know that the wise who have realized the truth will instruct thee in that knowledge through long prostration, supplication, and service.Learn this from those endowed with knowledge, through prostration, inquiry, and service offered to them. Those who are endowed with knowledge and are capable of showing the truth will give you the truth nearby.This you shall learn by prostrating yourself at the master's feet, questioning them, and serving them. The wise who have realized the truth will teach you wisdom.Knowing this, O Arjuna, you will not fall again into delusion in this way—by that knowledge, you will see all beings without exception in yourself and then in Me.Knowing this, O Pandava, you will not be deluded again in this way, and through it, you will see all beings, without exception, in the Self and also in Me.Knowing that thou shalt not, O Arjuna, again be deluded like this; and by that thou shalt see all beings in thyself and also in me.By knowing this, you will not be deluded again, O son of Pandu; and by this means, you will see all beings without exception in yourself, that is, in Me.Having known That, you shall never again be confounded; and, O Arjuna, by the power of that wisdom, you shall see all these people as if they were your own Self, and therefore as Me.Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners, you can cross over all sins by the boat of knowledge alone.Even if you are the worst sinner among all sinners, you can still cross over all wickedness with the raft of Knowledge alone.Even if thou art the most sinful of all sinners, yet thou shalt surely cross over all sins by the raft of knowledge.Even if you are the highest sinner among all sinners, you can cross over the ocean of all sins by the boat of knowledge.Even if you are the greatest of sinners, you will cross over all sin by the ferryboat of wisdom.Just as a burning fire turns fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge turn all karmas to ashes.O Arjuna, just as a blazing fire reduces wood to ashes, similarly the fire of Knowledge reduces all actions to ashes.As the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ash.Just as a fire that is well-inflamed reduces fuel to ashes, so too does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.As the kindled fire consumes the fuel, so, O Arjuna, the embers of action are burnt to ashes in the flame of wisdom.For there is no purifier equal to knowledge; he who is perfected in Karma Yoga finds this knowledge of his own accord in himself in due time.Indeed, there is nothing purifying here comparable to Knowledge. One who has become perfected over time through yoga, realizes That in their own heart.Verily, there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. He who is perfected in Yoga finds it within the Self in due time.In this world, there exists no purifier comparable to knowledge. One who becomes perfect in Yoga finds this, of their own accord, in their Self in due course.There is nothing in the world so purifying as wisdom; and he who is a perfect saint finds that at last within himself.He who has faith, is intent on it, and has mastered his senses, attains knowledge. Having attained knowledge, he quickly goes to supreme peace.The one who has faith, is diligent, and has control over their organs, attains Knowledge. Achieving Knowledge, one soon attains supreme Peace.The one who is full of faith, devoted to it, and has subdued their senses obtains this knowledge; and upon obtaining the knowledge, they attain the supreme peace immediately.He who has faith gains knowledge, if he is solely intent upon it and has his sense-organs well-controlled. Having gained the knowledge, he soon attains the Supreme Peace.He who is full of faith attains wisdom, and he who can control his senses, having attained that wisdom, will soon attain Supreme Peace.The ignorant, the faithless, and the doubting one perish; for the doubting one, there is neither this world nor the one beyond, nor happiness.One who is ignorant and faithless, and has a doubting mind, perishes. Neither this world nor the next, nor happiness, exists for one who has a doubting mind.The ignorant, the faithless, and the doubting self go to destruction; there is neither this world nor the other, nor happiness for the doubting one.But he who is ignorant and has no faith, perishes, with his mind full of doubts. Neither this world nor the other, nor happiness is for a person who is by nature full of doubts.But the ignorant man, and he who has no faith, and the skeptic are lost. Neither in this world nor elsewhere is there any happiness in store for him who always doubts.Actions do not bind him, O Arjuna, who has renounced them through Karma Yoga and whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, and who thus possesses a steady mind.O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), actions do not bind one who has renounced actions through yoga, whose doubts have been fully dispelled by Knowledge, and who is not inattentive.He who has renounced actions through Yoga, whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, and who is self-possessed—such a one is not bound by actions, O Arjuna.O Dhananjaya! Actions do not bind him who has renounced all actions through Yoga; who has cut off his doubts by the sword of knowledge; and who is a master of his own self.But the one who has renounced their actions for meditation, who has cleaved their doubts in two by the sword of wisdom, and who remains always enthroned in their Self, is not bound by their actions.Therefore, sever, with the sword of knowledge, this doubt present in your heart resulting from ignorance concerning the Self. Practice this Yoga, O Arjuna, and arise.Therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, take recourse to yoga and rise up, cutting asunder with the sword of knowledge this doubt in your heart, arising from ignorance.Therefore, with the sword of knowledge (of the Self), cut asunder the doubt of the self, born of ignorance, residing in your heart, and take refuge in Yoga. Arise, O Arjuna!Therefore, thus cutting off, by means of the sword of knowledge, the doubt that has sprung from ignorance and exists in your heart, practice the Yoga! Stand up, O descendant of Bharata!Therefore, cleave asunder with the sword of wisdom the doubts of the heart, which your own ignorance has engendered, and follow the path of wisdom and arise!Arjuna said, "O Krsna, you praise the renunciation of actions, and then you also praise Karma Yoga. Please tell me with certainty which of these is the superior one, leading to the ultimate good.Arjuna said, "O Krsna, you praise renunciation of actions and, at the same time, Karma-yoga. Please tell me for certain which one is better between these two."Arjuna said, "O Krishna, you praise renunciation of actions and also yoga. Please tell me conclusively which is better of the two."Arjuna said, "O Krsna, you commend both renunciation of action and the Yoga of action; which one of these two is superior?" Please tell me that for certain.Arjuna said: My Lord! At one moment, You praise renunciation of action; at another, You praise right action. Tell me truly, I pray, which of these is more conducive to my highest welfare?The Lord said, "Renunciation of actions and Karma Yoga both lead to the highest excellence; however, of the two, Karma Yoga surpasses renunciation of actions."The Blessed Lord said, "Both renunciation of actions and Karma-yoga lead to liberation; however, Karma-yoga excels over renunciation of actions."The Blessed Lord said, "Renunciation and the Yoga of action both lead to the highest bliss; but of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action."The Bhagavat said, "Both renunciation and the Yoga of action effect salvation; however, of these two, the Yoga of action is superior to renunciation of action."Lord Shri Krishna replied: Both renunciation of action and the path of right action lead to the highest; however, right action is the better of the two.He who neither hates nor desires, and is beyond the pairs of opposites, is to be understood as an ever-renouncer. Therefore, he is easily set free from bondage, O Arjuna.He who neither hates nor craves should be known as a man of constant renunciation.He should be known as a perpetual Sannyasi who neither hates nor desires; for, free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily freed from bondage.That person may be considered a man of permanent renunciation, who neither hates nor desires. For, O mighty-armed one! He who is free from the pairs of opposites is easily released from bondage of action.He is a true ascetic who never desires nor dislikes, who is unaffected by the opposites and is easily freed from bondage.Children, not the learned, speak of Sankhya and Yoga as distinct; however, he who is firmly set in one, attains the fruit of both.The fools, not the learned ones, speak of Sankhya and (Karma-) yoga as being different. Anyone who properly resorts to either one of them gets the results of both.Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and the Yoga of action, or the performance of action, as though they are distinct and different; he who is truly established in one, obtains the fruits of both.The childish, and not the wise, proclaim the paths of knowledge and Yoga to be different. He who has properly resorted to even one of these two, gets the fruit of both.Only the unenlightened speak of wisdom and right action as separate; the wise do not. If anyone knows one, they enjoy the fruit of both.That state which is reached by the Sankhyans, the same is also attained by the Yogins; that is, the same state is achieved by those who are Karma Yogins. He alone is wise who perceives that the Sankhya and the Yoga are one and the same, due to their having the same result.The state that is reached by the Sankhyas, and that is also reached by the yogis, is seen by one who sees Sankhya and yoga as one.That place which is reached by the Sankhyas or the Jnanis is also reached by the Yogis (Karma Yogis). He who sees knowledge and the performance of action (Karma Yoga) as one, sees truly.Those who are knowledgeable reach the same state as those who practice Yoga; so whoever sees the knowledge-path and the Yoga as one, sees correctly.The level which is attained through wisdom is also reached through right action. He who perceives that the two are one, knows the truth.But, O mighty-armed one, renunciation is hard to attain without practicing Yoga. The sage who contemplates and follows Yoga soon reaches the Brahman (the self or Atman).But, O mighty-armed one, renunciation is hard to attain without (Karma-) yoga. The meditative man equipped with yoga attains Brahman without delay.But, O mighty-armed Arjuna, renunciation is hard to attain without Yoga; the sage who is in harmony with Yoga quickly goes to Brahman.O mighty-armed Arjuna! Renunciation is indeed hard to attain, except through Yoga; the sage who is the master of Yoga quickly attains the Brahman.Without concentration, O Mighty One, renunciation is difficult. But the sage who is always meditating on the Divine, shall soon attain the Absolute.He who follows the Yoga and is pure in mind, who has subdued his self and has conquered his senses, and whose self has become the self of all beings, even while he is acting, remains untainted.Endowed with yoga, pure in mind, controlled in body, a conqueror of the organs, the Self of the selves of all beings—he does not become tainted even while performing actions. When this person resorts to nitya and naimittika rites and duties as a means to the achievement of full illumination, and thus becomes fully enlightened, then, even when he acts through the apparent functions of the mind, organs, etc., he does not become affected.He who is devoted to the path of action, whose mind is pure, who has conquered the self, who has subdued his senses, and who realizes his Self as the Self in all beings, though acting, is not tainted.A master of yoga, whose self (mind and intellect) is very pure, the sense-organs are controlled, and the soul is realized to be the soul of all beings—he is not stained, even though he is a performer of actions.He who is spiritual, pure, has overcome his senses and his personal self, and has realized his highest Self as the Self of all—even though he acts, he is not bound by his actions.The one who knows the truth and is devoted to yoga should think, "I am not doing anything," even though they are seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, and breathing.- Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, 'I certainly do not do anything', even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, releasing, holding, opening, and closing the eyes—remembering that the organs function in relation to the objects of the organs.I do nothing at all," thus would the harmonized knower of Truth think, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, and breathing.A master of Yoga, knowing the reality, would think, 'I do not perform any action at all.' For, he who, while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, and breathing;Though the saint sees, hears, touches, smells, eats, moves, sleeps, and breathes, yet he knows the truth and knows that it is not he who acts.Speaking, discharging, grasping, opening, and closing his eyes, etc., he should always bear in mind that the senses operate among sense-objects.- Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, 'I certainly do not do anything', even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, releasing, holding, opening, and closing the eyes—remembering that the organs function in relation to the objects of the organs.Speaking, letting go, seizing, opening, and closing the eyes, one should be convinced that the senses move among the sense-objects.Taking, rejecting, receiving, opening, and closing the eyes, bear in mind that the sense-organs are on their respective objects; andThough he talks, gives, receives, opens his eyes, and shuts them, he still knows that his senses are merely disporting themselves among the objects of perception.He who acts without attachment, reposing all actions on Brahman (Prakṛti), is untouched by evil, just as a lotus leaf is untouched by water.One who acts by dedicating their actions to Brahman and by renouncing attachment, they do not become polluted by sin, just as a lotus leaf is not by water.He who does actions, offering them to Brahman and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin, just as a lotus leaf is not tainted by water.Who performs actions by offering them to the Brahman and giving up attachment—they are not stained by sin, just as a lotus leaf is not stained by water.He who dedicates his actions to the Spirit, without any personal attachment to them, is no more tainted by sin than the water lily is wetted by water.Yogins, renouncing attachment, do actions with merely the body, mind, intellect, and senses, for the purification of the self.By giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work solely through the body, mind, intellect, and even the organs, for their own purification.Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform actions only through the body, mind, intellect, and even the senses, for the purification of the self.Having given up attachment, the men of Yoga perform action just with the body, with the mind, with intellect, and also with their sense-organs, for attaining the Self.The sage performs his action dispassionately, using his body, mind, intellect, and even his senses, always as a means for purification.A yogi, renouncing the fruits of their actions, attains lasting peace. But the unsteady person who is attached to the fruits of their actions, being driven by desire, is bound.Giving up the results of work by becoming resolute in faith, one attains peace arising from steadfastness. One who is lacking in resolute faith, being attached to the results under the impulse of desire, becomes bound.The one who is united (the well-poised or harmonized) having abandoned the fruit of action attains eternal peace; whereas the one who is not united (the unsteady or unbalanced), impelled by desire and attached to the fruit, is bound.Having abandoned attachment to the fruit of actions, the master of Yoga attains the highest Peace. But, one who is not a master of Yoga and is attached to the fruit of action, is bound by their actions born of desire.Having abandoned the fruit of action, he wins eternal peace. Others, unacquainted with spirituality, led by desire and clinging to the benefit they think will follow their actions, become entangled in them.The embodied self, mentally resigning all actions as belonging to the city of nine gates (i.e., the body) and becoming self-controlled, dwells happily, neither acting himself nor causing the body to act.The embodied man of self-control, having given up all actions mentally, continues happily in the city of nine gates, without doing or causing anyone else to do anything.Mentally renouncing all actions and being self-controlled, the embodied one happily rests in the nine-gated city, neither acting nor causing others (body and senses) to act.Having renounced all actions by mind, a man of self-control dwells happily in his body, a nine-windowed mansion, neither performing nor causing others to perform any actions.Mentally renouncing all actions, the self-controlled soul enjoys bliss in this body, the city of the nine gates, neither doing anything themselves nor causing anything to be done.The Lord of the body (the Self, i.e., the Jiva) does not create agency, nor actions, nor union with the fruits of actions in relation to the world of selves; only the inherent tendencies function.The Self does not create agency or any objects of desire for anyone, nor does it associate with the results of actions; rather, it is Nature that acts.Neither does the Lord create agency nor actions for the world, nor union with the fruits of actions; rather, it is Nature that acts.The Lord (Self) acquires neither the state of being a creator of the world, nor the actions, nor the connection with the fruits of their actions. But it is the inherent nature [in It] that exerts.The Lord of this universe has not ordained activity, nor any incentive thereto, nor any relation between an act and its consequences; all this is the work of Nature.The all-pervasive One takes away neither the sin nor the merit of anyone. Knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, and creatures are thereby deluded.The Omnipresent neither accepts anyone's sin nor even virtue; knowledge remains covered by ignorance, thus the creatures become deluded.The Lord takes neither the demerit nor the merit of any; knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, and beings are deluded.The Omnimanifest Soul takes neither sin nor merit born of any action upon itself. But, perfect knowledge is clouded by Illusion, and thus the creatures are deluded.The Lord does not accept responsibility for any person's sin or merit; they are deluded, for wisdom is submerged in ignorance within them.But for those in whom this ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self, that knowledge, in their case, is supreme and shines brightly like the sun.But in the case of those whose ignorance is destroyed by knowledge (of the Self), their knowledge, like the sun, reveals that supreme Reality.But to those whose ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self, like the sun, knowledge reveals the Supreme Brahman.In the case of those whose illusion has been destroyed by Self-knowledge, that knowledge illuminates itself, like the sun.Surely, wisdom is like the sun, revealing the supreme truth to those whose ignorance has been dispelled by the wisdom of the Self.Those whose intellects pursue it, whose minds think about it, who undergo discipline for it, and who hold it as their highest object, have their impurities cleansed by knowledge and go from whence there is no return.Those whose intellect is absorbed in That, whose Self is That, who are steadfast in That, and who have That as their supreme Goal—they attain the state of non-returning, their impurities having been removed by Knowledge.Their intellect absorbed in That, their self being That, established in That, with That as their supreme goal, they go whence there is no return, their sins dispelled by knowledge.Those who have their intellect and self (mind) devoted to This; who have established themselves in This and have This [alone] as their supreme goal; and who have washed off their sins through [perfect] knowledge—they reach a state from which there is no more return.Meditating on the divine, having faith in the divine, concentrating on the divine, and losing themselves in the divine, their sins dissolve in wisdom, and they go from whence there is no return.The sages look with an equal eye on one endowed with learning and humility, a Brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater.The learned ones look with equanimity on a Brahmana endowed with learning and humility, a cow, an elephant, and even a dog, as well as one who eats dog meat.Sages look with an equal eye on a Brahmana endowed with learning and humility, on a cow, an elephant, a dog, and even an outcaste.The wise, by nature, look equally upon a Brahmana, rich in learning and humility, a cow, an elephant, and even a dog and a dog-cooker (an outcaste).Sages look upon all equally, whether they be a minister of learning and humility, an infidel, a cow, an elephant, or a dog.Here itself, those whose minds rest in equanimity overcome samsara. For the Brahman (individual self), when uncontaminated by Prakriti, is the same everywhere; therefore, they abide in Brahman.Here itself is mirth attained by those whose minds are established in sameness. Since Brahman is the same in all and free from defects, they are established in Brahman.Even here in this world, those whose minds rest in reality overcome birth; Brahman is indeed spotless and real; therefore they are established in Brahman.The one who knows Brahman, who is disillusioned, established in Brahman, and has a firm intellect, would neither rejoice upon meeting a friend nor get agitated upon meeting a foe.Even in this world, those whose minds remain always balanced, fixed on the Supreme, conquer their earthly life; for the Supreme has neither blemish nor bias.He who knows Brahman (individual self) and abides in Brahman, whose mind is steadfastly focused on the self and undeluded by body consciousness—he neither rejoices at gaining what is pleasant nor grieves on obtaining what is unpleasant.A knower of Brahman, who is established in Brahman, should have their intellect steady and should not be deluded. They should not get delighted by getting what is desirable, nor become dejected by getting what is undesirable.Resting in Brahman, with a steady intellect and undeluded, the knower of Brahman neither rejoices upon obtaining what is pleasant nor grieves upon obtaining what is unpleasant.He who, with his mind not attached to external contacts, finds happiness in the Self—that person, with his mind engaged in Yoga, easily pervades the Brahman, suffering no loss.He who knows and lives in the Absolute remains unmoved and unperturbed; he is not elated by pleasure nor depressed by pain.He whose mind is detached from external contact and finds happiness in the Self—he has his mind engaged in the contemplation of Brahman and enjoys undecaying bliss.With his heart unattached to external objects, he gets the bliss that is in the Self. With his heart absorbed in meditation on Brahman, he acquires undying Bliss.With the self unattached to external contacts, he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in the meditation of Brahman, he attains endless happiness.The enjoyments that arise from contact [with objects] are nothing but sources of misery, having both a beginning and an end. Therefore, an intelligent person does not take delight in them, O son of Kunti!He finds happiness in his own Self and enjoys eternal bliss, whose heart does not yearn for the contacts of the earth and whose Self is one with the Everlasting.For those pleasures that are born of contact are wombs of pain. They have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna; the wise do not rejoice in them.Since enjoyments that result from contact with objects are indeed the sources of sorrow, having a beginning and an end, O son of Kunti, the wise one does not delight in them.The enjoyments that arise from contact are only sources of pain, for they have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna; the wise do not rejoice in them.Whosoever, right here, before abandoning the body, is capable of bearing the force sprung from desire and wrath—he is considered to be a man of Yoga and a happy man.The joys that spring from external associations bring pain; they have their beginnings and their endings. The wise person does not rejoice in them.He who is able, even here, before being released from the body, to bear the impulse generated by desire and anger, he is a Yogin (competent for self-realisation); he is the happy man.One who can withstand here itself, before departing from the body, the impulse arising from desire and anger, that person is a yogi; they are happy.He who is able, while still here in this world, to withstand the impulse born out of desire and anger before the liberation from the body, he is a Yogi, and he is a happy man.He, whose pleasure, delight, and light are all within—O son of Prtha!—he attains the supreme Yoga, becoming the Brahman himself.He who, before leaving his body, learns to overcome the promptings of desire and anger, is a saint and is happy.He whose joy is within, whose pleasure is within, and whose light is within—he is a yogin, who, having become Brahman, attains the bliss of Brahman.One who is content within, whose pleasure is within, and whose light is only within, that yogi, having become Brahman, attains absorption into Brahman.He who is happy within, who rejoices within, and who is illuminated within, that Yogi attains absolute freedom, or Moksha, becoming Brahman himself.The seers, whose doubts have decayed; by whom dualities have been cut off; whose minds are controlled; and who delight in the welfare of all; they attain the Brahman, the Transcendent One.He who is happy within himself and has found its peace, and in whom the inner light shines, that sage attains eternal bliss and becomes one with the spirit.The sages, who are free from the pairs of opposites, whose minds are well subdued, and who are devoted to the welfare of all beings, become cleansed of all impurities and attain the bliss of Brahman.The seers whose sins have been attenuated, who are free from doubt, whose senses are under control, who are engaged in doing good to all beings, attain absorption in Brahman.The sages obtain absolute freedom or Moksha when their sins have been destroyed, their dualities have been torn asunder, they are self-controlled, and they are intent on the welfare of all beings.At all times, there is the transcendent Brahman for the ascetics who have severed their connection with desire and anger, who have controlled their minds and have realized their Self.Sages whose sins have been washed away, whose sense of separateness has dissipated, who have subdued themselves, and seek only the welfare of all, come to the Eternal Spirit.To those who are free from desire and wrath, who are accustomed to exerting themselves, whose thoughts are controlled, and who have conquered it—the beatitude of Brahman is close at hand.To those monks who have control over their internal organs, who are free from desire and anger, who have known the Self, there is absorption into Brahman either way.Absolute freedom exists on all sides for those self-controlled ascetics who are free from desire and anger, who have controlled their thoughts, and who have realized the Self.Warding off external contacts; keeping the sense of sight between the two wandering ones; counterbalancing both the forward and backward moving forces that travel within what is crooked;Saints who know themselves, who control their minds, and feel neither desire nor anger, find eternal bliss everywhere.Shutting off outward contacts, fixing the gaze between the eyebrows, realizing inward and outward breaths moving in the nostrils;- Keeping external objects outside, fixing the eyes at the juncture of the eye-brows, and controlling the outgoing and incoming breaths that move through the nostrils, the contemplative who has mastery over his organs, mind, and intellect should be fully intent on Liberation and free from desire, fear, and anger. He who is ever thus is verily free.Shutting out all external contacts and fixing the gaze between the eyebrows, realizing the outgoing and incoming breaths moving within the nostrils.The sage, who has controlled his sense-organs, mind, and intellect; whose chief aim is emancipation; and from whom desire, fear, and wrath have departed—he remains ever free.Excluding external objects, with his gaze fixed between the eyebrows, and the inward and outward breathings passing equally through his nostrils;The sage who has controlled his senses, mind, and intellect, who is intent on release as his final goal, freed forever from desire, fear, and wrath, is indeed liberated forever.- Keeping external objects outside, fixing the eyes at the juncture of the eye-brows, and controlling the outgoing and incoming breaths that move through the nostrils, the contemplative who has mastery over his organs, mind, and intellect should be fully intent on Liberation and free from desire, fear, and anger. He who is ever thus is verily free.With the senses, mind, and intellect ever controlled, having liberation as their supreme goal, free from desire, fear, and anger, the sage is truly liberated forever.Having known Me as the Enjoyer of the fruits of sacrifices and austerities, as the great Lord of all the worlds, and as the Friend of all beings, he attains peace.Governing sense, mind, and intellect, intent on liberation, free from desire, fear, and anger, the sage is eternally free.Knowing Me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, as the Supreme Lord of all worlds, as the Friend of every being, he attains peace.One attains peace by knowing Me, who am the great Lord of all the worlds, the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, and the friend of all creatures.He who knows Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds, and the friend of all beings, attains peace.There is no such translation for this shloka.Knowing Me as the One who gladly receives all offerings of austerity and sacrifice, as the Mighty Ruler of all the Worlds and the Friend of all beings, he passes to Eternal Peace.The Lord said, "He who performs works that ought to be done without seeking their fruits—he is a sannyasin and yogin, and not he who maintains no sacred fires and performs no actions."The Blessed Lord said, "He who performs an action which is his duty, without depending on the result of the action, is a monk and a yogi; not so in he who does not keep afire and is actionless."The Blessed Lord said: He who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actions—he is a sannyasi and a yogi, not he who is without fire and without action.The Bhagavad said, "He who performs his bounden action without depending on its fruit is the man of renunciation and the man of Yoga, not he who simply remains without his fires and actions."Lord Shri Krishna said: He who acts out of duty, without considering the consequences, is truly spiritual and a true ascetic; not he who merely observes rituals or shuns all action.That which is called Sannyasa (Jnana Yoga), know that to be Yoga (Karma Yoga), O Arjuna. For no one, among Karma Yogins, whose delusive identification of the body with the self has not been abandoned, becomes a true Karma Yogin.That which they call monasticism, know that to be Yoga, O Pandava, for nobody who has not given up expectations can be a yogi.Do you, O Arjuna, know that Yoga is what they call renunciation; no one indeed becomes a Yogi who has not renounced their thoughts.What the learned call renunciation, O son of Pandu, know that to be the same as the Yoga. For, without renouncing intention for fruit, one does not become a man of Yoga.O Arjuna, renunciation is indeed what is known as right action. No one can become spiritually enlightened who has not renounced all desires.Action is said to be the means for the sage who seeks to climb the heights of Yoga; but when he has climbed the heights of Yoga, tranquility is said to be the means.For the sage who wishes to ascend to (Dhyana-) yoga, action is said to be the means. For that person, once he has ascended to (Dhyana-)yoga, inaction alone is said to be the means.For a sage who wishes to attain to Yoga, action is said to be the means; for the same sage who has attained Yoga, inaction is said to be the means.For a sage, who is desirous of mounting upon the Yoga, action is said to be the cause; for the same sage, when he has mounted upon the Yoga, stillness is said to be the cause.For the sage who seeks the heights of spiritual meditation, practice is the only method, and when they have attained it, they must maintain themselves there through continual self-control.For, when one loses attachment to the things of the senses and to actions, then they have abandoned all desires and are said to have climbed the heights of Yoga.Verily, when a man who has given up thought about everything does not get attached to sense-objects or actions, he is then said to be established in Yoga.When a person is not attached to the sense-objects or to actions, having renounced all thoughts, then they are said to have attained Yoga.When a person indulges neither in what is desired by the senses nor in the actions for it, then, being a man who has renounced all intentions, he is said to have mounted on the path of Yoga.When a man renounces even the thought of initiating action, and is not interested in sense objects or any results that may flow from his acts, then he truly understands spirituality.One should raise oneself by one's own mind and not allow oneself to sink; for the mind alone is the friend of the self, and the mind alone is the foe of the self.One should save oneself by oneself; one should not degrade oneself. For oneself is indeed one's own friend; oneself is indeed one's own enemy.One should raise oneself by one's own self alone; let not one lower oneself; for the self alone is one's own friend, and the self alone is one's own enemy.Let a person lift themselves by themselves and let them not depress themselves. For, the self alone is the friend of the self and the self alone is the foe of the self.Let him seek liberation with the help of his Highest Self, and never disgrace his own Self. For that Self is his only friend; yet it can also be his enemy.The mind is the friend of him by whom it has been conquered. But for him whose mind is not conquered, the mind, like an enemy, remains hostile.He who has conquered his own self by the self, his self is his own friend. But for one who has not conquered his own self, his self itself acts like an enemy.The Self is the friend of the self of him by whom the Self has been conquered; but to the unconquered self, this Self stands in the position of an enemy, like an external foe.The Self is the friend of that Self by which the Self has been verily subdued; but in the case of a person with an unsubdued Self, the Self alone would abide in enmity like an enemy.To one who has conquered their lower nature with its help, the Self is a friend; but to one who has not done so, it is an enemy.Of him whose mind is conquered and who is serene, the great self is well-secured in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor.The supreme Self of one who has control over the aggregate of his body and organs, and who is tranquil, becomes manifest. He should be poised in the midst of cold and heat, happiness and sorrow, as well as honor and dishonor.The Supreme Self of him who is self-controlled and peaceful remains balanced in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well as in honor and dishonor.The thinking of the person, with a subdued mind and thus with complete calmness, remains in equilibrium in the case of others and himself, in cold and heat, in pleasure and pain, as well as in honor and dishonor.The Self of one who is self-controlled and has attained peace is equally unmoved by heat or cold, pleasure or pain, honor or dishonor.The yogin whose mind is content with knowledge of the self and also with knowledge of the difference between the self and Prakrti, who is established in the self, whose senses are subdued, and to whom earth, stone, and gold all seem alike, is called integrated.One whose mind is satisfied with knowledge and realization, who is unmoved, who has his organs under control, is said to be Self-absorbed. The yogi treats all alike, a lump of earth, a stone, and gold.The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and wisdom of the Self, who has conquered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone, and gold are all the same, is said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi.He whose self is satisfied with knowledge and with what consists of varied thoughts; who remains peak-like and has completely subdued his senses; and to whom a clod, a stone, and a piece of gold are the same—that man of Yoga is called a master of Yoga.He who desires nothing but wisdom and spiritual insight, who has conquered his senses, and who looks upon a lump of earth, a stone, and fine gold with the same eye, is a real saint.He who regards with an equal eye well-wishers, friends, foes, the indifferent, neutrals, the hateful, the relations, and even the good and the sinful—he excels.He excels who has sameness of view with regard to a benefactor, a friend, an enemy, a neutral, an arbiter, the hateful, a relative, good people, and even sinners.He who is of the same mind towards the good-hearted, friends, enemies, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful, the relatives, the righteous, and the unrighteous, excels.He whose mind is equal in the case of friend, companion, enemy, the indifferent one, the one who remains in the middle, the foe, the relative, the righteous, and also the sinful—he excels [all].He looks impartially on all—lovers, friends, or foes; indifferent, hostile, alien, or relative; virtuous or sinful.The yogin should constantly fix his mind on yoga, remaining in a solitary place all alone, controlling his thoughts and mind, free from desire and a sense of possession.A yogi should constantly concentrate his mind by staying in a solitary place, alone, with mind and body controlled, free from expectations, and free from acquisition.Let the yogi constantly strive to keep the mind steady, remaining in solitude, alone, with the body and mind controlled, and free from hope and greed.Let the man of Yoga always yoke the self (mind) by remaining alone in a lonely place, controlling his mind and body, without desire and without a sense of possession.Let the student of spirituality try unceasingly to concentrate his mind; let him live in seclusion, absolutely alone, with his mind and personality controlled, free from desire and without possessions.Having established for himself, in a clean spot, a firm seat that is neither too high nor too low, and covering it with cloth, deer-skin, and Kusa grass in reverse order—Having firmly established in a clean place his seat, neither too high nor too low, composed of cloth, skin, and kusa-grass placed successively one below the other;In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low, made of cloth, skin, and kusha grass layered one over the other.Setting up in a clean place his own suitable, firm seat predominantly made of cloth, skin, and kusa-grass, neither too high nor too low for him;Having chosen a holy place, let him sit in a firm posture on a seat that is neither too high nor too low, and cover it with a grass mat, a deer skin, and a cloth.Sitting on the seat, with a concentrated mind, controlling the mind and senses, one should practice Yoga for the purification of the self.Sitting on that seat, he should concentrate his mind for the purification of the internal organ, making the mind one-pointed and keeping the actions of the mind and senses under control.There, having made the mind one-pointed, with the actions of the mind and senses controlled, let him, seated on the seat, practice Yoga for the purification of the self.Sitting there on the seat and making the mind single-pointed, let him, with the activities of his mind and senses subdued, practice Yoga for self-purification.Seated thus, with his mind concentrated, his functions controlled, and his senses governed, let him practice meditation for the purification of his lower nature.Holding the trunk, head, and neck erect, motionless and steady, gazing at the tip of the nose and not looking in any direction;Holding the body, head, and neck erect and still, being steady, looking at the tip of his own nose and not looking around.Let him firmly hold his body, head, and neck erect and still, gazing at the tip of his nose without looking around.Holding the body, head, and neck erect and motionless; remaining firm; looking properly at one's own nose-tip; and not looking in different directions.Let him hold his body, head, and neck erect, motionless and steady; let him look fixedly at the tip of his nose, turning neither to the right nor to the left.Serene and fearless, firm in their vow of celibacy, controlling their minds and fixing their thoughts on Me, they should sit in Yoga, intent on Me.He should remain seated with a placid mind, free from fear, firm in the vow of celibacy, and with the mind fixed on Me by controlling it through concentration, having Me as the supreme goal.Serene-minded, fearless, firm in the vow of a Brahmachari, having controlled their mind, thinking of Me and balanced in mind, let them sit, having Me as their supreme goal.Being calm-minded, fearless, and firmly devoted to celibacy; controlling the mind completely; let the master of Yoga remain, fixing his mind on Me and having Me as his supreme goal.With peace in his heart and no fear, observing the vow of celibacy, with his mind controlled and fixed on Me, let the student lose himself in contemplation of Me.Applying his mind in this way, the Yogin of controlled mind, ever attains the peace which is the summit of beatitude and which abides in Me.Concentrating the mind thus, forever, the yogi of a controlled mind achieves the peace that culminates in liberation and abides in Me.Thus, always keeping the mind balanced, the yogi, with the mind controlled, attains the peace abiding in Me, culminating in liberation.Yoking his mind incessantly in this manner, My devotee, with their mind not attached to anything else, realizes peace which culminates in nirvana and ends in Me.Thus, keeping his mind always in communion with Me and subduing his thoughts, he shall attain that Peace which is Mine and will lead him to liberation at last.Yoga is not for him who overeats, nor for him who fasts excessively; not for him, O Arjuna, who sleeps too much, nor for him who stays awake too long.But, O Arjuna, Yoga is not for one who eats excessively, nor for one who does not eat at all; neither for one who habitually sleeps too long, nor for one who stays awake.Verily, Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at all, nor for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who is always awake, O Arjuna.Yoga is neither for him who eats too much, nor for him who totally abstains from eating, nor for him who is prone to sleeping too much, nor for him who keeps awake too much.Meditation is not for him who eats too much, nor for him who eats not at all; not for him who is overly addicted to sleep, nor for him who is always awake.Yoga becomes the destroyer of sorrows for those who are temperate in food and recreation, temperate in their actions, and temperate in their sleep and wakefulness.Yoga becomes a destroyer of sorrow for one whose eating and movements are regulated, whose effort in works is moderate, and whose sleep and wakefulness are temperate.Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is moderate in eating and recreation (such as walking, etc.), who exercises moderation in action, and who is moderate in sleep and wakefulness.The Yoga becomes a misery-killer for him whose effort for food is appropriate, exertion in activities is proper, and whose sleep and waking are proportionate.But for him who regulates his food and recreation, who is balanced in action, in sleep, and in waking, it shall dispel all unhappiness.When the subdued mind rests solely on the Self, then, free from all yearning for objects of desire, one is said to be fit for Yoga.A person who has become free from hankering for all desirable objects is said to be Self-absorbed when the controlled mind rests solely in the Self.When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self alone, free from longing for any of the objects of desire, then it is said, 'He is united'.When his mind, well-controlled, is established in nothing but the Self, and he is free from craving for any desired object—at that time he is called a master of Yoga.When the mind is completely controlled, centered in the Self, and free from all earthly desires, then the man is truly spiritual.A lamp does not flicker in a windless place"—that is the simile used for the tranquil mind of a yogi who practices yoga.As a lamp kept in a windless place does not flicker, so is the simile for the yogi whose mind is under control and who is engaged in concentration on the Self.As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker, so is the Yogi of a controlled mind, who practices Yoga in the Self, compared.Just as a lamp in a windless place does not shake, this simile is recalled in the case of the man of Yoga, with a subdued mind, practicing Yoga in the Self.The wise man who has conquered his mind and is absorbed in the Self is like a lamp that does not flicker, as it stands sheltered from every wind.Where the mind, controlled through the practice of Yoga, rests, and where one sees the Self by the Self and is delighted by the Self alone.At the time when the mind, restrained through the practice of Yoga, is withdrawn, and just when one sees the Self by the self and remains contented in the Self alone;When the mind, restrained by the practice of yoga, attains quietude, and when one sees the Self by the Self, they are satisfied in their own Self.Where the mind, restrained through yoga practice, remains still; and where, observing, the yogi finds satisfaction in the Self alone, by perceiving only the Self within.There, where the whole of nature is seen in the light of the Self, where the person abides within their Self and is satisfied there, their functions restrained by their union with the Divine, the mind finds rest.Where one knows that infinite happiness which can be grasped by the intellect but is beyond the reach of the senses, and is established in that condition, one does not swerve from it.When one experiences that absolute Bliss, which can be intuited by the intellect and which is beyond the senses, and being thus established, this person surely does not swerve from Reality.When he (the Yogi) feels that infinite bliss which can be grasped by the pure intellect and which transcends the senses, and is established therein, never moving away from the reality.Where he realizes the limitless Bliss, which is to be grasped by intellect and is beyond the senses; remaining where he does not depart from the Reality.When he enjoys the bliss that surpasses the senses and can only be grasped by the pure intellect, when he comes to rest within his highest self, he will never again stray from reality.Having gained it, one holds that there is no greater gain; being established in it, one is not moved even by the heaviest sorrow.Obtaining which one does not consider any other acquisition to be superior, and being established in which one is not perturbed even by great sorrow;Having obtained it, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; established in it, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.And having attained it, he does not think of any other gain as superior to that; being established in it, he is not shaken much by misery, however powerful it may be.Finding That, he will realize that there is no possession so precious. And once established there, no calamity can disturb him.Know this deliverance from association with misery to be Yoga. This Yoga must be practiced with determination and with a mind free from despondency.One should know that severance of contact with sorrow to be what is called Yoga. That Yoga should be practiced with perseverance and with an undepressed heart.Let this be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga should be practiced with determination and with an undespairing mind.That he would realize to be the cause for his cessation of contact with misery and to be the one made known by Yoga. With determination, that is to be yoked in Yoga by a person of undepressed mind (or of the depressed mind).This inner severance from the affliction of misery is spirituality. It should be practiced with determination and with a heart that refuses to be depressed.Renouncing entirely all desires born of volition and restraining the mind from all the senses on all sides,By totally eschewing all desires that arise from thoughts and restraining all the organs with the mind from every side;Abandoning unreservedly all desires born of Sankalpa (thought and imagination) and completely restraining the whole group of senses by the mind from all sides.In order to renounce completely all desires that are born of intention, let a person restrain the group of sense-organs from all sides by mind alone.Renouncing every desire that can be imagined, controlling the senses at every point through the power of the mind;Little by little, one should withdraw oneself from objects other than the self, with the help of the intellect held by firm resolution; and then one should think of nothing else, having fixed the mind upon the Self.One should gradually withdraw with the intellect, endowed with steadiness. Making the mind fixed in the Self, one should not think of anything at all.Little by little, let him attain steadiness of the intellect by holding it firmly; having made the mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything else.Very slowly remain still, keeping the mind well established in the Self by means of the intellect held in steadiness; and let him not think of anything (object).Little by little, with the help of his reason controlled by fortitude, let him attain peace; and, fixing his mind on the Self, let him not think of anything else.Wherever the fickle and unsteady mind wanders, one should subdue it and then bring it back under the control of the self alone.The yogi should bring this mind under the subjugation of the Self itself, restraining it from all those causes that cause the restless, unsteady mind to wander away.From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, let him restrain it from that and bring it under the control of the Self alone.By whatever things the shaky and unsteady mind strays, let him restrain it from those things and bring it back under the control of the Self alone.When the volatile and wavering mind wanders, let him restrain it and bring it back to its allegiance to the Self.For supreme happiness comes to the Yogin whose mind is at peace, who is free from evil, from whom Rajas has departed, and who has become the Brahman.Supreme Bliss comes to this yogi alone whose mind has become perfectly tranquil, whose quality of rajas has been eliminated, who has become identified with Brahman, and is untainted.Supreme Bliss indeed comes to this Yogi whose mind is made peaceful, whose passion is quelled, who has become Brahman, and who is free from sin.Indeed, the Supreme Bliss comes to this highly tranquil-minded man of Yoga, whose passions remain stilled, who has become one with the Brahman, and who is free from sins.Supreme bliss is the lot of the sage whose mind attains peace, whose passions subside, who is without sin, and who becomes one with the Absolute.Thus, devoting himself to the Yoga of the Self, freed from impurities, the yogin easily attains the supreme bliss of contact with the Brahman.By constantly concentrating his mind in this way, the taintless yogi easily attains the absolute bliss of contact with Brahman.The yogi, always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of yoga), is freed from sins and easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with Brahman (the Eternal).Thus, yoking the self always, the man of Yoga, with a subdued mind, easily attains complete union, that is, the Brahman.Thus, free from sin, abiding always in the Eternal, the saint enjoys, without effort, the bliss that flows from the realization of the Infinite.He whose mind is fixed in Yoga sees reality everywhere; he sees his Self as abiding in all beings and all beings in his Self.One who has their mind Self-absorbed through Yoga, and who has the vision of sameness everywhere, sees this Self existing in everything, and everything in their Self.With the mind harmonized by Yoga, he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.He who has yoked himself in Yoga and observes everything truly perceives the Self to be abiding in all beings and all beings to be abiding in the Self.He who experiences the unity of life sees his own Self in all beings, and all beings in his own Self, and looks upon everything with an impartial eye.To him who sees Me in every self and every self in Me—I am not lost to him, nor is he lost to Me.One who sees Me in everything and sees all things in Me—I do not lose sight of him, and he also is not lost to My vision.He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, never becomes separated from Me, nor do I from him.He who observes Me in all and observes all in Me—for him, I am not lost, and he too is not lost for me.He who sees Me in everything and everything in Me, I shall never forsake him, nor shall he lose Me.The yogi who, fixed in oneness, worships Me dwelling in all beings—he abides in Me, no matter how he may live.That yogi, who, being established in unity, adores Me as existing in all things, exists in Me—in whatever condition he may be.He who, being established in unity, worships Me, who dwells in all beings, that yogi abides in Me, whatever their mode of living may be.He who is firmly established in the oneness of Me, experiences Me immanent in all beings—that man of Yoga is never stained, no matter what stage he may be in.The sage who realizes the unity of life and who worships Me in all beings, lives in Me, no matter what their lot may be.He who, due to the similarity of selves everywhere, sees pleasure or pain as the same everywhere—that yogi, O Arjuna, is considered the closest.O Arjuna, that yogi is considered the best who judges what is happiness and sorrow in all beings by the same standard as they would apply to themselves.He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees reality everywhere, be it pleasure or pain, is regarded as the highest Yogi.Whoever finds pleasure or pain equally in all, as if it were in themselves—that person is considered to be a great man of Yoga, O Arjuna!O Arjuna! He is the perfect saint who, having been taught by the likeness within himself, sees the same Self everywhere, regardless of whether the outer form be pleasurable or painful.Arjuna said, "O Krsna, this Yoga of reality, which You have declared, I do not see how it can be steady due to the fickleness of the mind."Arjuna said, "O Madhusudana (Krsna), this Yoga that You have spoken of as sameness, I do not see its steady continuance due to the restlessness of the mind."Arjuna said, "O Krishna, I do not see how this Yoga of equanimity, which you have taught me, can be maintained steadily, due to the restlessness of the mind."Arjuna said, "O slayer of Mandhu, this Yoga of equanimity which You have spoken of, I do not find a proper foundation for it due to the unsteadiness of the mind."Arjuna said: I do not see how I can attain this state of equanimity which You have revealed, owing to the restlessness of my mind.For the mind is fickle, O Krsna, impetuous, powerful, and stubborn; I think that restraining it is as difficult as restraining the wind.For, O Kṛṣṇa, the mind is unsteady, turbulent, strong, and obstinate; I consider its control to be as difficult as that of the wind.The mind is indeed restless, turbulent, strong, and unyielding, O Krishna; I consider it as difficult to control as controlling the wind.O Krsna! The mind is indeed unsteady, destructive, strong, and obstinate; I believe it is very difficult to control it, just as it is to control the wind.My Lord! Verily, the mind is fickle and turbulent, obstinate, and strong; indeed, it is extremely difficult to control, like the wind.The Lord said, "The mind is indeed hard to subdue and fickle, O mighty-armed one, but, O son of Kunti, it can be brought under control through practice and the exercise of dispassion."The Blessed Lord said, O mighty-armed one, undoubtedly the mind is untamable and restless. But, O son of Kunti, it can be brought under control through practice and detachment.The Blessed Lord said, "Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but with practice and dispassion, it can be restrained."The Bhagavat said, O mighty-armed one! No doubt, the mind is unsteady and hard to control. But it can be controlled through practice and an attitude of desirelessness, O son of Kunti!Lord Shri Krishna replied: Doubtless, O Mighty One, the mind is fickle and exceedingly difficult to restrain; however, O Son of Kunti, with practice and renunciation, it can be done.In my opinion, Yoga is hard to attain by a person of an unrestrained mind; however, it can be attained through the right means by one who strives for it and has a subdued mind.My conviction is that Yoga is difficult to attain for one with an uncontrolled mind. But it is possible to attain through the aforementioned means for one who strives and has a controlled mind.I think Yoga is hard to be attained by one with an uncontrolled self, but the self-controlled and striving one can attain it by the appropriate means.My belief is that attaining Yoga is difficult for a person with an uncontrolled mind; but it is possible to attain by proper means with a subdued self.It is not possible to attain Self-Realization unless one knows how to control oneself; however, for one who, striving by the proper means, learns such control, it is possible.Arjuna said, "If a person who is possessed of faith but has put in only inadequate effort finds his mind wandering away from Yoga, and then fails to attain perfection—what way does he go, O Krishna?"Arjuna said, "O Krsna, what goal does one attain who, despite having faith, fails to achieve perfection in Yoga due to lack of diligence, and whose mind becomes deflected from Yoga?"Arjuna said, "He who is unable to control himself, even though he has faith, and whose mind wanders away from Yoga, what end does he meet, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, O Krishna?"Arjuna said, "A person who has faith and is desirous of reaching the path of the good, but whose mind has been severed from Yoga—to which goal does he go, having failed to attain success in Yoga? O Krsna!"Arjuna asked: What of him who fails to control himself, whose mind falls from spiritual contemplation, yet retains his faith and does not attain perfection?Without any support, confused in the path leading to the Brahman, and thus having fallen from both, does he not perish, O mighty-armed one, like a rent cloud?O Mighty-armed one, having fallen from both [paths], without support, deluded on the path to Brahman, does he not get ruined like a scattered cloud?Fallen from both, does he not perish like a rent cloud, supportless, O mighty-armed one, deluded on the path of Brahman?Does he, fallen from both, get lost like a broken cloud? Or, O mighty-armed one! Having no support, does he meet total destruction?Having failed in both, my Lord, is he without hope, like a riven cloud with no support, lost on the spiritual path?O Krsna, you should altogether remove this doubt of mine, for there is no other remover of this doubt than you.O Krsna, you should totally eradicate this doubt of mine, for none other than yourself can be the dispeller of this doubt!O Krishna, please completely dispel this doubt of mine, for it is not possible for anyone but You to do so.Please dispel this doubt of mine completely. But for You, O Krsna, no one else is capable of eradicating this doubt.My Lord! You are worthy to solve this doubt once and for all; there is no one else competent to do so, save Yourself.The Lord said, "Neither here in this world nor there in the next is there destruction for him. For no one who does good ever comes to an evil end."The Blessed Lord said, "O Partha, there is certainly no ruin for him here or hereafter, for no one engaged in good meets with a deplorable end, my son!"The Blessed Lord said, "O Arjuna, neither in this world nor in the next will there be destruction for him; none, indeed, who does good, O my son, ever comes to grief."The Bhagavat said, "O dear Partha! Neither in this world nor in the other is there destruction for him. Certainly, no one who performs an auspicious act ever comes to a grievous state."Lord Shri Krishna replied: My beloved child! There is no destruction for him, either in this world or the next. No evil fate awaits him who treads the path of righteousness.He who has fallen away from Yoga is born again in the house of the pure and prosperous, having attained to the worlds of doers of good deeds and dwelled there for many long years.Attaining the worlds of the righteous and residing there for eternal years, the man who has fallen from Yoga is born in the house of the pious and prosperous.Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and having dwelt there for everlasting years, he who fell from Yoga is born in a house of the pure and wealthy.Having attained the worlds of those who perform pious acts, and having resided there for years of eternity, the one who has fallen from Yoga is born again in the house of the pure and wealthy.Having reached the worlds where the righteous dwell, and having remained there for many years, he who has strayed from the path of spirituality will be born again into the family of the pure, benevolent, and prosperous.Or he is born into a family of wise yogis. But such a birth in this world is rare.Or, he is born in the family of wise yogis. Such a birth is indeed more difficult to come by in the world.Or he is born in a family of even the wisest of yogis; verily, such a birth is very difficult to obtain in this world.Or, he is born nowhere else but in the family of the intelligent men of Yoga; for, this birth is more difficult to obtain in the world.Or, he may be born in the family of wise sages, though such a birth is indeed very difficult to obtain.There, O Arjuna, he regains the disposition of mind that he had in his former body, and from there he strives even more for success in Yoga.There he becomes endowed with the wisdom acquired in the previous body, and he strives even more than before for perfection, O scion of the Kuru dynasty.Then he comes into contact with the knowledge acquired in his former body and strives even more for perfection, O Arjuna.There, in that life, he regains the link of mentality transmitted from his former body. Consequently, once again he strives for full success, O rejoicer of the Kurus!Then, the experience acquired in his former life will revive, and with it, he will more eagerly strive for perfection than before.By the power of his earlier practice, he is carried forward even against his will. Even though he is an enquirer about Yoga, he transcends the Sabda-Brahman, i.e., Prakṛti or matter.For, by that very past practice, he is carried forward even in spite of himself! Even a seeker of Yoga transcends the results of the performance of Vedic rituals!By that same former practice, he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely wishes to know Yoga goes beyond the Brahmanic word.Not being a master of himself, he is only dragged by that former practice (its mental impression); only a seeker of the knowledge of Yoga passes beyond what strengthens the [sacred] text.Unconsciously, he will return to the practices of his old life; thus, one who strives to attain spiritual consciousness is certainly superior to one who merely talks about it.But the yogi, striving earnestly, cleansed of all his stains and perfected through many births, reaches the supreme state.However, the yogi, applying himself assiduously, becoming purified from sin and attaining perfection through many births, they achieve the highest Goal.But the Yogi who strives assiduously, purified of sins and perfected gradually over many births, reaches the highest goal.After that, the assiduous man of Yoga, having his sins completely cleansed and being perfected through many births, reaches the Supreme Goal.Then, after many lives of earnest striving and absolution of sins, the student of spirituality attains perfection and reaches the Supreme.Greater than the ascetics, greater than those who possess knowledge, greater than the ritualists is the Yogin. Therefore, O Arjuna, become a Yogin.A yogi is higher than those of austerity; they are considered higher even than those of knowledge. The yogi is also higher than those of action. Therefore, O Arjuna, become a yogi.The yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics, even superior to those who have knowledge obtained through the study of scriptures; he is also superior to men of action; therefore, be thou a yogi, O Arjuna.The person of Yoga is superior to the persons of austerities and is considered superior even to the persons of knowledge; and the person of Yoga is superior to the persons of action. Therefore, O Arjuna! you should become a person of Yoga.The wise person is superior to the ascetic, the scholar, and the man of action; therefore, be thou a wise person, O Arjuna!He who, with faith, worships Me, and whose innermost self is fixed in Me, I consider him to be the greatest of the Yogins.Even among all the yogis, he who adores Me with his mind fixed on Me and with faith is considered by Me to be the best of the yogis.And among all the Yogis, he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me, worships Me is deemed by Me to be the most devoted.He who has faith and serves Me with his inner self devoted to Me, is considered by Me to be the best of all yogis.I look upon him as the best of mystics, who, full of faith, worships Me and abides in Me.The Lord said, "With your mind focused on Me, taking Me as your support, and practicing yoga—how can you, without doubt, know Me fully? Hear, O Arjuna."The Blessed Lord said, "O Partha, hear how, with your mind fixed on Me, practicing the Yoga of Meditation and taking refuge in Me, you will certainly and fully know Me.The Blessed Lord said, "O Arjuna, hear how you shall, without doubt, know Me fully, with your mind intent on Me, practicing Yoga and taking refuge in Me."The Bhagavat said, "O son of Prtha, hear from Me how, with your mind attached to Me, practicing yoga, and taking refuge in Me, you shall understand Me fully, without any doubt."Lord Shri Krishna said: Listen, O Arjuna! I will tell you how you can know Me in my full perfection. Practice meditation with your mind devoted to Me and take Me as your refuge.I will declare to you in full this knowledge of God, along with the knowledge that makes it distinguished, knowing which nothing else remains to be known.I shall tell you in detail of this Knowledge, which is combined with realization, after experiencing which there remains nothing else here to be known.I will declare to you in full this knowledge combined with realization, after knowing which nothing else remains to be known here.I shall teach you this knowledge in full, together with action; for a person who has known this, there remains nothing else to be known in this world.I will reveal this knowledge to you and how it can be realized; once accomplished, there is nothing else worth having in this life.Among thousands of men, some strive for perfection; even among those who strive for perfection, only some know Me; and among those who know Me, only some truly know Me.Among thousands of men, a rare one endeavors for perfection. Even among the perfected ones who are diligent, one perchance knows Me in truth.Among thousands of men, one may perchance strive for perfection; even among those successful strivers, only one may perchance know Me in essence.Among thousands of men, perhaps one makes an effort for the determined knowledge. Among those, even though they make an effort, perhaps one realizes Me correctly with the determined knowledge.Among thousands of men, scarcely one strives for perfection, and even among those who gain occult powers, perhaps only one knows me in truth.Earth, water, fire, air, ether, Manas, Buddhi, and the ego-sense—thus My Prakriti is divided into eight parts.This Prakrti of Mine is divided eightfold thus: earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect, and egoism.Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, and egoism—thus is My Nature divided eightfold.My nature is divided into eight parts: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Ether, Mind, Intellect, and Ego.Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, and personality—this is the eightfold division of My manifested nature.This is My lower Prakṛti. But, O mighty-armed one, know that My higher nature is another. It is the life-principle (Jīva-bhūta), by which this universe is sustained.O mighty-armed one, this is the inferior Prakrti. Know the other Prakrti of Mine, which is however higher than this, which has taken the form of individual souls, and by which this world is upheld.O mighty-armed Arjuna, this is the inferior Prakriti; know it as distinct from My higher Prakriti, the very life-element, by which this world is upheld.This is My lower nature. My superior nature, which has become the individual Soul and by which this world is maintained, is not different from this. O mighty-armed Arjuna, you must know this.This is My inferior nature; however, O valiant one, know that distinct from this is My superior nature, which is the very life that sustains the universe.Know that all beings have these two as the source of their birth. Therefore, I am the origin and the dissolver of the whole universe.Understand thus that all things—sentient and insentient—have these as their source. I am the origin as well as the end of the entire universe.Know that these two are the womb of all beings; thus, I am the source and dissolution of the whole universe.All beings are born from this womb; hence, keep them close. I am the origin and dissolution of the entire world.It is the womb of all beings; for I am He by Whom the worlds were created and shall be dissolved.There is nothing higher than Me, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, like rows of gems on a thread.O Dhananjaya, there is nothing else higher than Myself. All this is strung on Me like pearls on a string.There is nothing higher than Me, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, like clusters of gems on a string.There is nothing beyond Me, O Dhananjaya; all this is strung on Me, just as pearls are strung on a string.O Arjuna! There is nothing higher than Me; all is strung on Me like rows of pearls on a thread.I am the taste in the waters, O Arjuna! I am the light in the sun and the moon; the sacred syllable Om in all the Vedas; sound in the ether; and manhood in men, I am.O son of Kunti, I am the taste of water, I am the effulgence of the moon and the sun; the letter 'Om' in all the Vedas, the sound in space, and manhood in men.I am the flavor in water, O Arjuna; I am the light in the moon and the sun; I am the syllable Om in all the Vedas, sound in the ether and virility in men.O son of Kunti! I am the taste in waters, the light in the moon and sun, the best hymn (OM) in the entire Vedas, the sound that exists in the ether, and the manly vigor in men.O Arjuna! I am the fluidity in water, the light in the sun and moon, the mystic syllable Om in the Vedic scriptures, the sound in ether, and the virility in man.I am the pure scent in the earth; I am the radiance in the fire; I am the life-force in all beings, and austerity in ascetics.I am also the sweet fragrance in the earth; I am the brilliance in the fire, and the life in all beings; and I am the austerity of the ascetics.I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the brilliance in the fire, the life in all beings, and I am the austerity of ascetics.I am the pure scent in the earth; I am also the radiance in the sun; I am the life in all beings and the austerity in the ascetics.I am the fragrance of the earth, the brilliance of fire, the life force in all beings, and the austerity of ascetics.Know Me, O Arjuna, to be the primeval seed of all beings. I am the intelligence of the discerning and the brilliance of the brilliant.O Partha, know Me to be the eternal seed of all beings. I am the intellect of the intelligent, and I am the courage of the courageous.Know Me, O Arjuna, as the eternal seed of all beings; I am the intelligence of the intelligent, and the splendour of the splendid objects.O son of Prtha! Know Me as the eternal seed of all beings; I am the intellect of the intellectuals and the brilliance of the brilliant.Know, O Arjuna, that I am the eternal seed of being; I am the intelligence of the intelligent, the splendour of the resplendent.In the strong, I am strength, devoid of desire and passion. In all beings, I am the desire which is not contrary to Dharma, O Arjuna.And of the strong, I am the strength that is devoid of passion and attachment. Among creatures, I am desire that is not contrary to righteousness, O scion of the Bharata dynasty.Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment, and in all beings, I am the desire in accordance with Dharma, O Arjuna.Of the strong, I am the strength that is free from desire and attachment. O best of the Bharatas, in all beings, I am the desire that is not contrary to dharma.I am the strength of the strong, those who are free from attachment and desire; and, O Arjuna, I am the desire for righteousness.Know that all those states of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas are from Me alone; however, I am not in them; rather, they are in Me.Those things that are made of the quality of sattva, and those things that are made of the quality of rajas and tamas, know them to have sprung from Me alone. However, I am not in them; they are within Me!Whatever beings (and objects) that are pure, active, and inert, know that they proceed from Me. They are in Me, yet I am not in them.Whatever beings are there—whether they are of the Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas strands—be sure that they are from Me; I am not in them, but they are within Me.Whatever be the nature of their life, whether it be pure, passionate, or ignorant, they are all derived from Me. They are in Me, but I am not in them.The entire universe is deluded by these three states originating from the Gunas (of Prakrti), and fails to recognize Me, who am beyond them and immutable.All this world, deluded as it is by these three qualities made of the gunas, does not know Me, who am transcendental to these and undecaying.Deluded by these Natures, composed of the three qualities of Nature, all this world does not know Me as distinct from them and immutable.Being deluded by these three strands of nature, this entire world does not recognize Me, who am eternal and transcend these strands.The inhabitants of the world, misled by the natures engendered by the Qualities, do not know that I am higher than them all and that I do not change.(a) For this divine Maya or Mine, consisting of the three Gunas (assumed for purposes of sport), is hard to overcome.
৷৷
(b) ৷৷ But those who take refuge in Me alone shall pass beyond the Maya.Since this divine Maya of Mine, which is constituted by the gunas, is difficult to cross over, those who take refuge in Me alone can transcend this Maya.Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, composed of the three qualities, is difficult to cross over; those who take refuge in Me alone, can cross over this illusion.This is My divine play, composed of the strands of illusion, and it is hard to cross over. Those who take refuge in Me alone, they cross over the illusion.Verily, this divine illusion of phenomenon manifesting itself in the qualities is difficult to surmount. Only they who devote themselves exclusively to Me can accomplish it.The evil-doers, the foolish, the lowest of men, those persons deprived of knowledge by delusion (Maya) and those who are dominated by a demoniac nature - they do not seek refuge in Me.The foolish evildoers, who are the most depraved among men, who are deprived of their wisdom by Maya, and who resort to demonic ways, do not take refuge in Me.The evil-doers and the deluded, who are the lowest of men, do not seek Me; those whose knowledge is destroyed by illusion follow the ways of demons.The deluded evil-doers, the vilest of men, who are robbed of knowledge by the trick of illusion and have taken refuge in the demonic nature—they do not resort to Me.The sinner, the ignorant, the vile, deprived of spiritual perception by the glamour of illusion, and he who leads a godless life—none of them shall find me.Four types of men of good deeds worship Me, O Arjuna: the distressed, the seekers of knowledge, the seekers of wealth, and the men of knowledge.O Arjuna, foremost of the Bharata dynasty, four classes of people of virtuous deeds adore Me: the afflicted, the seekers of Knowledge, the seekers of wealth, and the man of Knowledge.Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna, and they are the distressed, the seekers of knowledge, the seekers of wealth, and the wise, O Lord of the Bharatas.Men of good action who always worship Me are of four types: the afflicted, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the man of wisdom, O best among the Bharatas!O Arjuna! The righteous who worship Me are grouped in stages: first, those who suffer, next those who desire knowledge, then those who thirst after truth, and lastly those who attain wisdom.Of these, the man of knowledge, who is ever with Me in Yoga and devoted to the One only, is the foremost; for I am very dear to the man of knowledge, and he is also dear to Me.Of them, the man of knowledge, endowed with constant steadfastness and one-pointed devotion, excels. For I am very dear to the man of knowledge, and he too is dear to me.Of them, the wise who are ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excel; for I am exceedingly dear to the wise, and they are dear to Me.Of them, the man of wisdom, being always attached to Me with single-pointed devotion, excels. For, I am dear to the man of wisdom above all personal gains, and he is dear to Me.Of all these, he who has gained wisdom, who meditates on Me without ceasing, devoting himself solely to Me, is the best; for I am exceedingly beloved by the wise man, and the wise man is also beloved by Me.All these are indeed generous, but I deem the man of knowledge to be My very self; for he, integrated, is devoted solely to Me as the highest end.Indeed, all of these are noble, but the man of Knowledge is the Self itself. This is my opinion. For, with a steadfast mind, he is set on the path leading only to Me, who am the supreme Goal.Indeed, all these are noble; however, I consider the wise man as My very Self; for, he is steadfast in mind and established in Me alone as the supreme goal.All these are indeed noble persons. But the man of wisdom is considered as the very Soul of Mine. For, with his self (mind) that has mastered the Yoga, he has resorted to Me alone as his most supreme goal.Noble-minded are they all, but the wise man I hold as my own self; for he, remaining always at peace with me, makes me his ultimate goal.At the end of many births, the man of knowledge finds refuge in Me, realizing that 'Vasudeva is all.' It is very difficult to find such a great-souled person.At the end of many births, the man of knowledge attains Me, realizing that Vasudeva is all. Such a high-souled one is very rare.At the end of many births, the wise man comes to Me, realizing that all this is Vaasudeva (the innermost Self); such a great soul (Mahatma) is very hard to find.At the end of many births, one attains Me with the conviction that 'All is Vasudeva'- that noble soul is very difficult to attain.After many lives, at last the wise one realizes Me as I am. It is very difficult to find a man so enlightened that he sees God everywhere.Controlled by their inherent nature, and deprived of knowledge by various desires, worldly-minded people resort to other gods, observing various disciplines.People, deprived of their wisdom by desires for various objects and guided by their own nature, resort to other deities, following the relevant methods.Those whose wisdom has been taken away by this or that desire, go to other gods, following this or that rite, led by their own nature.Being robbed of their wisdom by innumerable desires and controlled by their own nature, persons take refuge in other deities, following one or the other religious regulations.They in whom wisdom is obscured by one desire or another, worship the lesser powers, practicing many rites that vary according to their temperaments.Whichever devotee seeks to worship with faith whatever form, I make their faith steadfast.Whichever form of a deity any devotee wants to worship with faith, I strengthen that very firm faith of theirs.Whatever form any devotee desires to worship with faith, I make that same faith of his firm and unflinching.Whatever form of deity a devotee, whomever they may be, desires to worship with faith, I assume that form which is firm and is according to their faith.But whatever form of worship, if the devotee has faith, then I set My own seal upon their faith in that worship.Endowed with that faith, he worships that form and thereby gets the objects of his desire, granted in reality by Me alone.Being imbued with that faith, that person engages in worshipping that form, and they get those very desired results as dispensed by Me alone.Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that form and obtains his desired outcome, which is ordained by Me alone.Endowed with that faith, he seeks to worship that deity and thereby receives his desired objects, which are ordained by none other than Me.If he worships one form alone with real faith, then his desires shall be fulfilled through that alone; for thus I have ordained.But the fruit gained by these men of small understanding is limited. The worshippers of the gods will go to the gods, but My devotees will come to Me.The result of those who are of poor intellect is indeed limited. The worshippers of gods go to the gods, while My devotees go to Me alone.Verily, the reward (fruit) that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The worshippers of the gods go to them, whereas My devotees come to Me.But the fruit of those of poor intellect is finite; those who perform sacrifices aiming at the gods go to the gods, and My devotees come to Me.The fruit that comes to people of limited insight is, after all, finite. Those who worship the Lower Powers attain them; but those who worship Me come to Me alone.Not knowing My higher, immutable, and unsurpassed nature, the ignorant think of Me as an entity that has now become manifest, though I was previously unmanifest.The unintelligent, unaware of My supreme state which is immutable and unsurpassable, think of Me as having become manifest from the unmanifest.The foolish think of Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, not knowing My higher, immutable, and most excellent nature.Those of poor intellect are not aware of My higher, unchanging, and supreme nature; and thus, they consider Me, the Unmanifest, to be manifest.The ignorant think of Me, who am the Unmanifested Spirit, as if I were in human form. They do not understand that My Superior Nature is unchanging and most excellent.Veiled by my Maya, I am not manifest to all; this deluded world does not recognize me as the unborn and immutable.Being enveloped by yoga-maya, I do not become manifest to all. This deluded world does not know Me, who am birthless and undecaying.I am not manifest to all, veiled as I am by the Yoga-Maya. This deluded world does not know Me, who am unborn and imperishable.Being surrounded by the trick of yoga-illusion, I am not clear to all; hence, this deluded world of perceivers does not recognize Me, the unborn and undying.I am not visible to all, for I am enveloped by the illusion of the Phenomenon. This deluded world does not know Me as the Unborn and Imperishable.I know all beings, O Arjuna, past, present, and those to come; but no one knows Me.O Arjuna, I know the past, present, and future beings; but no one knows Me!I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, the present, and the future; however, no one knows Me.O Arjuna, I know the beings that have gone, that are present, and those yet to be born; but no one knows Me.I know, O Arjuna, all beings in the past, the present, and the future; but they do not know Me.O Arjuna, all beings are deluded as soon as they are born, due to the delusion of the pairs of opposites springing from desire and hate.O scion of the Bharata dynasty, O destroyer of foes, due to the delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes, all creatures become bewildered upon their birth.O Bharata, all beings are subject to delusion at birth due to the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O Parantapa.O descendant of Bharata, O scorcher of foes! At the time of creation, all beings become deluded due to the illusion of pairs of opposites arising from desire and hatred.O brave Arjuna! Man lives in a fantastical world, deceived by the glamour of opposing sensations, infatuated by desire and aversion.But those who have done good deeds, whose sins have come to an end, are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites. They steadfastly worship Me, adhering to their vows.On the other hand, those persons who have done virtuous deeds, whose sin has come to an end, they, being free from the delusion of duality and firm in their convictions, adore Me.But those men of virtuous deeds, whose sins have come to an end and who are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me steadfastly, with their vows.But those men of virtuous deeds, whose sin has come to an end—they, being free from the delusion of pairs [of opposites], worship Me with a firm resolve.But those who act righteously, in whom sin has been destroyed, who are free from the infatuation of conflicting emotions, they worship Me with a firm resolve.Those who take refuge in Me and strive for deliverance from old age and death, know Brahman (or the Self) and all about the nature of that Self, and the entire Karma (or activities leading to rebirth).Those who strive by resorting to Me for becoming free from old age and death, they know Brahman, the individual Self, and all about actions. [They know Brahman as being all the individual entities and all actions. This verse prescribes meditation on the qualified Brahman for aspirants of the middle class. Verses beginning with the 14th speak about the realization of the unqualified Brahman by aspirants of the highest class.]Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, realize in full that Brahman, the whole knowledge of the Self, and all action.Those who, relying on Me, strive to achieve freedom from old age and death, realize all to be the Brahman and realize all the actions governing the Self.Those who make Me their refuge, striving for liberation from decay and death, realize the Supreme Spirit, which is their own real Self, and in which all action finds its consummation.And those who know Me with the Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, and Adhiyajna, they too, with their minds fixed in meditation, know Me even at the hour of death.Those who know me as existing in both the physical and divine planes, and also in the context of the sacrifice, they with concentrated minds know me even at the time of death.Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta (pertaining to the elements), Adhidaiva (pertaining to the gods), and the Adhiyajna (pertaining to the sacrifice) know Me even at the time of death, remaining steadfast in mind.Those who realize Me as one [identical] with what governs the beings, deities, and with what governs the sacrifices—they, even at the moment of their departure, experience Me, having mastered the Yoga.Those who see Me in the life of the world, in the universal sacrifice, and as pure Divinity, keeping their minds steady, they live in Me even in the hour of death's approach.Arjuna said, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What exists in the individual plane? What is action? What is said to exist in the physical plane? And what is said to exist in the divine plane?Arjuna said, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What exists in the individual plane? What is action? What is said to exist in the physical plane? And what is said to exist in the divine plane?Arjuna said, "What is Brahman? What is Adhyatma? What is action, O best among men? What is Adhibhuta declared to be? And, what is Adhidaiva said to be?"Arjuna said, "What is Brahman? What is known as the Lord of the Self (Adhyatma)? What is action? O Best of Persons, what is said to be the Lord of material things (Adhibhuta)? What is called the Lord of divinities (Adhidaiva)?"Arjuna asked: O Lord of Lords! What is that which people call the Supreme Spirit, what is humanity's spiritual nature, and what is the law? What is matter and what is divinity?O Madhusudana, how is the entity existing in the sacrifice here in this body, and who is it? And how are You to be known by people of concentrated minds at the time of death?O Madhusudana, how is the entity existing in the sacrifice here in this body, and who is it? And how are You to be known by people of concentrated minds at the time of death?Who and how is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of Madhu? And how, at the time of death, are You to be known by the self-controlled?Who is the Lord of Sacrifices, and how? Who is in this body? O slayer of Madhu, how can the self-controlled realize You at the time of their journey (i.e., death)?Who rules the spirit sacrifice in many, and how may those who have learned self-control come to the knowledge of Thee at the time of death?The Blessed Lord said, "The Immutable is the supreme Brahman; selfhood is said to be the entity present in the individual plane. By action is meant the offerings that bring about the origin of existence of things."The Blessed Lord said, "The Immutable is the supreme Brahman; selfhood is said to be the entity present in the individual plane. By action is meant the offerings that bring about the origin of existence of things."The Blessed Lord said, "Brahman is the Imperishable, the Supreme; its essential nature is called Self-knowledge; the offering (to the gods) that causes the existence and manifestation of beings and sustains them is called action."The Bhagavat said, "The immutable Absolute is the Brahman. Its intrinsic nature is called the Lord of the Self. The emitting activity that causes the birth of both the animate and inanimate is named 'action'."The Lord Shri Krishna replied: The Supreme Spirit is the Highest Imperishable Self, and Its nature is spiritual consciousness. The worlds have been created and are sustained by an emanation from the Spirit, which is called the Law.That which exists in the physical plane is the mutable entity, and what exists in the divine plane is the Person. O best among the embodied beings, I Myself am the entity that exists in the sacrifice within this body.That which exists in the physical plane is the mutable entity, and what exists in the divine plane is the Person. O best among the embodied beings, I Myself am the entity that exists in the sacrifice within this body.Adhibhuta—knowledge of the elements—pertains to My perishable nature, and the Purusha, or the Soul, is the Adhidaiva; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best among the embodied.The changing nature is the lord of the material beings; the Person alone is the lord of the divinities; I am alone the Lord of sacrifices, and I, the best of the embodied souls, dwell in this body.Matter consists of forms that perish; Divinity is the Supreme Self; and He who inspires the spirit of sacrifice in man, O noblest of their race, is I Myself, Who now stand in human form before thee.And at the time of death, anyone who departs, giving up the body while thinking of Me alone, attains My state; there is no doubt about this.And at the time of death, anyone who departs, giving up the body while thinking of Me alone, attains My state; there is no doubt about this.And whoever, leaving their body, goes forth remembering Me alone at the time of death, they will attain My Being; there is no doubt about this.Whosoever, at the time of death, remembering Me alone, sets forth, abandoning their body behind, they attain My being. There is no doubt about it.Whosoever, at the time of death, thinks only of Me and, thinking thus, leaves the body and goes forth, will assuredly know Me.O son of Kunti, thinking of any entity, whichever it may be, one gives up the body at the end; he attains that very one, having been always engrossed in its thought.O son of Kunti, thinking of any entity, whichever it may be, one gives up the body at the end; he attains that very one, having been always engrossed in its thought.Whoever at the end leaves the body, thinking of any being, to that being only does he go, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), due to his constant thought of that being.And also remembering whatever being one has been constantly thinking about, a person leaves his body at the end [of his life], O son of Kunti! That being alone he attains.Whatever sphere of being the mind of a man is intent on at the time of death, to that he will go.Therefore, think of Me at all times and fight; there is no doubt that by dedicating your mind and intellect to Me, you will attain only Me.Therefore, think of Me at all times and fight; there is no doubt that by dedicating your mind and intellect to Me, you will attain only Me.Therefore, at all times, remember Me only and fight. With your mind and intellect fixed on Me, you will undoubtedly come to Me alone.Therefore, at all times keep Me in your mind and fight; then, having your mind and intellect dedicated to Me, you will undoubtedly attain Me alone.Therefore, always meditate on Me and fight; if your mind and reason are fixed on Me, you will surely come to Me.O son of Prtha, by meditating with a mind engaged in the yoga of practice and not straying away to anything else, one reaches the supreme Person existing in the effulgent region.O son of Prtha, by meditating with a mind engaged in the yoga of practice and not straying away to anything else, one reaches the supreme Person existing in the effulgent region.With the mind not moving towards any other thing, made steadfast through the practice of habitual meditation, and constantly meditating, one goes to the Supreme Person, the Resplendent, O Arjuna.He who is engaged in reflecting on the Supreme Divine Soul with his mind, remaining fixed in the practice of yoga and not focusing on any other object, that person attains the Supreme, O son of Prtha!He whose mind does not wander, and who is engaged in constant meditation, attains the Supreme Spirit.He who meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler, subtler than the subtle, the Ordainer of everything, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun, and beyond darkness—he attains the Supreme Person.He who meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler, subtler than the subtle, the Ordainer of everything, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun, and beyond darkness—he attains the Supreme Person.Whosoever meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler of the whole world, minuter than an atom, the supporter of all, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun and beyond the darkness of ignorance.He who meditates continuously on the Ancient Seer, the Ruler, the subtler than the subtle, the supporter of all, the unimaginably formed, the sun-colored, and that which is beyond darkness;Whoso meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, more minute than an atom, yet the Ruler and Upholder of all, Unimaginable, Brilliant like the Sun, Beyond the reach of darkness;At the time of death, having fully fixed the Prana (vital force) between the eyebrows with an unwavering mind, and being imbued with devotion as well as the strength of concentration, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person.At the time of death, having fully fixed the Prana (vital force) between the eyebrows with an unwavering mind, and being imbued with devotion as well as the strength of concentration, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person.At the time of death, with an unwavering mind, endowed with devotion, by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole life-breath in the middle of the two eyebrows, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person.That person, endowed with a steady mind, devotion, and the power of yoga, reaches the Supreme Divine Soul at the time of departure, by properly fixing the life-breath between their eyebrows.He who leaves the body with an unmoved mind, filled with devotion, and by the power of his meditation gathers his whole vital energy between his eyebrows, attains the Supreme.I will briefly speak to you of that immutable Goal, which the knowers of the Vedas declare; into which diligent ones, free from attachment, enter, and for which people practice celibacy, aspiring.I will briefly tell you about that immutable Goal which the knowers of the Vedas declare; those who are diligent, free from attachment, and aspire for it, enter into it. People practice celibacy for it.That which is declared to be Imperishable by those who know the Vedas, that which the self-controlled (ascetics or Sannyasins) and passion-free enter, that goal, desiring which celibacy is practised, I will declare to thee in brief.That Unchanging One which the Vedic knowers speak of; which the passion-free ascetics enter into, seeking which they practice celibacy (or spiritual life); that Goal together with the means [to reach it] I shall tell you.Now, I will briefly speak of the imperishable goal, proclaimed by those who are versed in the scriptures, which the mystic attains when free from passion, and for which they are content to undergo the vow of continence.Having controlled all the senses, confined the mind in the heart, and fixed his own vital force in the head, he should remain steadfast in yoga.Having controlled all the senses, confined the mind in the heart, and fixed his own vital force in the head, he should remain firm in yoga.Having closed all the gates, confined the mind in the heart, and fixed the life-breath in the head, engage in the practice of concentration.Properly controlling all the gates of the body; restraining the mind firmly in the heat; fixing one's own prana in the head; taking refuge in the firmness of Yoga.Closing the gates of the body, drawing the forces of his mind into the heart, and, by the power of meditation, concentrating his vital energy in the brain;He who departs, leaving the body while uttering the single syllable, viz. "Om," which is Brahman, and thinking of Me, attains the supreme Goal.He who departs, leaving the body while uttering the single syllable, "Om," which is Brahman, and thinking of Me, attains the supreme Goal.Uttering the one-syllabled Om, the Brahman, and remembering Me, he who departs, leaving the body, attains the Supreme Goal.Reciting the single-syllabled Om, the very Brahman; meditating on Me; whoever travels well, casting away their body—surely they attain My State.Repeating Om, the symbol of eternity, and holding Me always in remembrance, he who thus leaves his body and goes forth reaches the Supreme Spirit.O son of Prtha, to that yogi of constant concentration and single-minded attention, who remembers Me uninterruptedly and for a long time, I am easy to attain.O son of Prtha, to that yogi of constant concentration and single-minded attention, who remembers Me uninterruptedly and for a long time, I am easily attained.I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast yogi who constantly and daily remembers me for a long time, not thinking of anything else with a single-minded or one-pointed focus, O Partha.And whoever constantly bears Me in mind, never attached to any other object—for this yogi, ever devoted, I am easy to attain, O son of Prtha!To him who constantly thinks of Me and nothing else, to such an ever-faithful devotee, O Arjuna, I am ever accessible.As a result of reaching Me, the exalted ones who have attained the highest perfection do not get birth, which is an abode of sorrows and is impermanent.As a result of reaching Me, the exalted ones who have attained the highest perfection do not get rebirth, which is an abode of sorrows and is impermanent.Having attained Me, these great souls do not take birth again here—a place of pain and impermanence—but have reached the highest perfection of liberation.Having attained Me, the men of great soul who have achieved the supreme perfection do not get the transient birth, a storehouse of all troubles.Coming to Me in this way, these great souls no longer go to the misery and death of earthly life, for they have achieved perfection.O Arjuna, all the worlds together with the world of Brahma are subject to return. But, O son of Kunti, there is no rebirth after reaching Me.O Arjuna, all the worlds together with the world of Brahma are subject to return. But, O son of Kunti, there is no return after reaching Me.All the worlds, including the world of Brahma, are subject to return again, O Arjuna; but he who reaches Me, O son of Kunti, has no rebirth.Till the Brahman is attained, people return from each and every world, O Arjuna! But there is no return for one who has attained Me, O son of Kunti!The worlds, along with the entire realm of creation, come and go; but, O Arjuna, whoever comes to Me, for them there is no rebirth.Those people who know what day and night are, know the day of Brahma which ends in a thousand yugas [The four yugas (in the human worlds), viz Satya, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali are made up of 4,320,000 years. This period multiplied by a thousand constitutes one day of Brahma. His night also extends over a similar period. See M.S. and V.S.A.], and His night which also ends in a thousand yugas.Those people who know what day and night are, know the day of Brahma which ends in a thousand yugas, and His night which also ends in a thousand yugas.Those who know the day of Brahma, which lasts a thousand Yugas, and the night, which also lasts a thousand Yugas, know day and night.Those who know the day of Brahma as encompassing one thousand yugas (world-ages), and night [also] as encompassing one thousand yugas—those people know the day and night of Brahma.Those who understand the cosmic day and night know that one day of creation is a thousand cycles, and that the night is of equal length.With the coming of day, all manifested things emerge from the Unmanifest, and when night comes, they merge into that which is called the Unmanifested.With the coming of day, all manifested things emerge from the Unmanifest, and when night comes, they merge into that which is called the Unmanifested.From the Unmanifested, all the manifested worlds proceed upon the arrival of the 'day'; upon the arrival of the 'night', they dissolve indeed into that which is known as the Unmanifested.As the day approaches, all manifestations emerge from the unmanifest, and as the night approaches, they dissolve into the same, which is known as the 'unmanifest.'At the dawn of that day, all objects in manifestation stream forth from the Unmanifest, and when evening falls, they are dissolved back into it again.O son of Prtha, after being born again and again, that very multitude of beings disappears of its own accord at the approach of night. It comes to life again at the approach of day.O son of Prtha, after being born again and again, that very multitude of beings disappears of its own accord at the approach of night. It comes to life again at the approach of day.This same multitude of beings, being born again and again, helplessly dissolves, O Arjuna, into the Unmanifested at the coming of the night and comes forth at the coming of the day.Being born and reborn, the same multitude of beings is dissolved when night approaches and is born again, willy-nilly, when day approaches, O son of Prtha!The same multitude of beings, which have lived on earth so often, all are dissolved as the night of the universe approaches, to issue forth anew when morning breaks. Thus, it is ordained.But distinct from that Unmanifested is the other eternal, unmanifest Reality, who does not get destroyed when all beings are destroyed.But distinct from that Unmanifested is the other eternal, unmanifest Reality, who does not get destroyed when all beings are destroyed.But verily, there exists higher than this Unmanifested, another Unmanifested Eternal, which is not destroyed even when all beings are destroyed.But there exists another Being which is beyond this, and It is both manifest and unmanifest and is eternal. It is this Being that does not perish while all other beings perish.In truth, therefore, there is the eternal, unmanifest, which is beyond and above the unmanifest spirit of creation, and which is never destroyed when all these beings perish.They call Him who has been mentioned as the Unmanifested, the Immutable, the supreme Goal. That is the supreme abode of Mine, from which they do not return once they reach it.They call Him who has been mentioned as the Unmanifested, the Immutable, the supreme Goal. That is the supreme abode of Mine, from which they do not return once they reach it.What is known as the Unmanifested and the Imperishable, That is said to be the highest goal. Those who reach It do not return (to this Samsara). That is My supreme abode (place or state).The scriptures speak of This as Unmanifest and Changeless, and declare This to be the highest Goal. Having attained it, people do not return; this is My highest abode.The wise say that the Unmanifest and Indestructible is the highest goal of all; when once that is reached, there is no returning. That is my blessed home.O son of Prtha, that supreme Person—in whom all beings are included and by whom all this is pervaded—is indeed reached through one-pointed devotion.O son of Prtha, that supreme Person—in whom all beings are included and by whom all this is pervaded—is, indeed, reached through one-pointed devotion.That highest Purusha, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Him alone, within Whom all beings dwell and by Whom all this is pervaded.O son of Prtha, the Supreme Soul is attainable through devotion that admits no other things; having attained it, the men of Yoga do not get birth again; within it exist the beings, and everything is well established in it, O Arjuna!O Arjuna! That Highest God, in Whom all beings abide, and Who pervades the entire universe, is reached only by wholehearted devotion. *He is the one who determines the course of worldly events and the destiny of all living beings.*O best of the Bharata dynasty, I shall now speak of that time by which the yogis depart and attain the State of Non-return, and also the State of Return.O best of the Bharata dynasty, I shall now speak of that time by which the yogis depart and attain the State of Non-return, and also the State of Return.Now I will tell you, O chief of the Bharatas, the times of departure at which the Yogis will return or not return.Departing at what times the Yogis attain the non-return or the return only—those times I shall declare to you, O chief of the Bharatas!Now, I will tell you, O Arjuna, the times at which, if the mystics go forth, they do not return, and at which they go forth only to return.Fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern solstice—by following this path, persons who are knowers of Brahman attain Brahman when they die.Fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern solstice—by following this path, persons who are knowers of Brahman attain Brahman when they die.Fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern path of the sun (the northern solstice) departing, then men who know Brahman go to Brahman.The northern course consisting of six months is fire, light, day, and bright. Departing in it, the Brahman-knowing men attain Brahman.If the sage, knowing the Supreme Spirit, goes forth with fire and light during the day, in the fortnight of the waxing moon, and in the six months before the Northern summer solstice, he will attain the Supreme.Following this Path, the yogi, having reached the lunar light, returns, smoke, night, as also the dark fortnight and the six months of the Southern solstice.Following this Path, the yogi, having reached the lunar light, returns, smoke, night, as also the dark fortnight and the six months of the Southern solstice.Attaining the lunar light through smoke, night time, the dark fortnight, and the six months of the southern path of the sun (the southern solstice), the yogi returns.The southern course of the sun, consisting of six months, is smoke, night, and darkness. Departing in it, the yogi attains the light of the moon and returns.But if he departs in gloom, at night, during the fortnight of the waning moon and in the six months before the winter solstice, then he reaches only lunar light and he will be reborn.These two paths of the world, which are white and black, are indeed considered eternal. Through one, a person goes to the state of non-return; through the other, they return again.These two paths of the world, which are white and black, are indeed considered eternal. Through one, a person goes to the state of non-return; through the other, they return again.The bright and dark paths of the world are thought to be eternal; one leads to no return, and the other leads to return.For, these two bright and dark paths are considered to be perpetual for the world. One attains non-return by the first of these, and one returns back by the other.These bright and dark paths out of the world have always existed. Whoever takes the former, does not return; he who chooses the latter, returns.O son of Prtha, no yogi—one steadfast in meditation—whosoever has known these two courses becomes deluded. Therefore, O Arjuna, be steadfast in yoga at all times.O son of Prtha, no yogi—one steadfast in meditation—whosoever has known these two courses becomes deluded. Therefore, O Arjuna, be steadfast in yoga at all times.Knowing these paths, O Arjuna, no yogi is deluded; therefore, at all times, be steadfast in yoga.O son of Prtha, no Yogin, knowing these two courses, gets deluded. Therefore, O Arjuna, practice Yoga connected with all times.O Arjuna! The saint, knowing these paths, is not confused; therefore, meditate perpetually.Having known this, the yogi transcends all the results of righteous deeds declared in the Vedas, sacrifices, austerities, and charities, and reaches the primordial, supreme state.Having known this, the yogi transcends all the results of righteous deeds declared in the Vedas, sacrifices, austerities, and charities, and reaches the primordial, supreme state.Whatever fruit of merit is declared (in the scriptures) to accrue from (the study of) the Vedas, (the performance of) sacrifices, (the practice of) austerities, and gifts, beyond all this goes the Yogi, having known this; and he attains to the Supreme, Primeval (first or ancient) Abode.Having understood all this, the Yogin goes beyond whatever fruit of merit is ordained in the scriptures in case of reciting the Vedas, performing sacrifices, observing austerities, and donating gifts; and he goes to the Supreme Primeval Abode.The sage who knows this passes beyond all merit that comes from the study of the scriptures, from sacrifice, from austerities, and from charity, and reaches the Supreme Primeval Abode.The Lord said, "I shall declare to you, who does not cavil, this most mysterious knowledge, together with its special knowledge, knowing which you will be freed from evil."The Blessed Lord said: However, to you who are not given to cavilling, I shall speak of this highest secret itself, which is knowledge combined with experience, by realizing which you shall be free from evil.The Blessed Lord said, "I shall now declare to thee, who does not cavil, the greatest secret—the knowledge combined with experience (Self-realisation). Having known this, thou shalt be free from evil."The Bhagavat said, "To you, who are entertaining no displeasure, I shall clearly declare this most secret knowledge, together with action, by knowing which you shall be free from evil."Lord Shri Krishna said: I will now reveal to you, since you do not doubt, that profound mysticism, which, when followed with experience, will liberate you from sin.This is the royal science, the royal mystery, the supreme purifier. It is realized through direct experience, is in accord with Dharma, is pleasant to practice, and is abiding.This is the sovereign knowledge, the sovereign profundity, the best sanctifier; directly realizable, righteous, very easy to practice, and imperishable.This is the royal science, the royal secret, the supreme purifier, realizable by direct intuitive knowledge, according to righteousness, very easy to perform and imperishable.This shines among the sciences; it is the secret of monarchs; it is a supreme purifier, comprehensible by immediate perception, righteous, easy to do, and imperishable.This is the supreme science, the supreme secret, the purest and best; it is intuitive, righteous, and to those who practice it, it is exceedingly pleasant.Men devoid of faith in this Dharma, O scorcher of foes, ever remain without attaining Me, on the mortal path of Samsara.O destroyer of foes, those who are disregarding this Dharma (knowledge of the Self) certainly go round and round, without reaching Me, along the path of transmigration which is fraught with death.Those who have no faith in this Dharma, O Parantapa, return to the path of this world without attaining Me.O scorcher of foes! Those who have no faith in this Dharma do not attain Me and remain eternally in the cycle of mundane existence, fraught with death.They who have no faith in this teaching cannot find Me; they remain lost in the purlieus of this perishable world.This entire universe is pervaded by Me, in an unmanifest form. All beings abide in Me, but I do not abide in them.This whole world is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All beings exist in Me, but I am not contained within them!All of this world is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest aspect; all beings exist within Me, but I do not dwell within them.This entire universe is pervaded by Me, having an unmanifest form; all beings exist in Me, and I do not exist in them.The whole world is pervaded by Me, yet My form is not visible. All living beings have their being in Me, yet I am not confined by them.Yet, beings do not remain in Me. Behold My divine Yoga. I am the sustainer of all beings, yet I am not in them. It is My will alone that causes their existence.Neither do the beings dwell in Me. Behold My divine Yoga! I am the sustainer and originator of beings, but My Self is not contained within the beings.Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality); behold, My divine Yoga, which supports all beings, but does not dwell in them, is My Self, the efficient cause of beings.Yet, the beings do not exist in Me. Look at My Sovereign Yoga. My Self is the sustainer of the beings; it does not exist in them, and causes them to be born.Nevertheless, they do not consciously abide in Me. Such is My Divine Sovereignty that, though I, the Supreme Self, am the cause and upholder of all, yet I remain outside.As the powerful element air, moving everywhere, ever remains in the ether, know that so too all beings abide in Me.Understand thus that just as the voluminous wind, moving everywhere, is ever present in space, similarly all beings abide in Me.As the mighty wind, moving everywhere, always rests in the ether, so too, know that all beings rest in Me.Just as the mighty wind exists in the ether, always moving therein everywhere, in the same manner all beings exist in Me. Be sure of it.As the mighty wind, though moving everywhere, has no resting place except in space, so all these beings have no home except in Me.All beings, O Arjuna, enter into My Prakriti at the end of a cycle of time; again, I send them forth at the beginning of a cycle of time.O son of Kunti, all the beings at the end of a cycle go back to My Prakrti. At the beginning of a cycle, I project them forth again.All beings, O Arjuna, go into My Nature at the end of a Kalpa; I send them forth again at the beginning of the next Kalpa.O son of Kunti, all beings pass into My nature at the end of the Kalpa (the age of universe); I send them forth again at the beginning of the [next] Kalpa.All beings, O Arjuna, return at the end of every cosmic cycle into the realm of Nature, which is a part of Me, and at the start of the next I send them forth again.Controlling the Prakṛti, which is My own, I send forth again and again this multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of Prakṛti.Keeping My own prakṛti under control, I project forth again and again this multitude of beings, which are powerless due to the influence of their own nature.Animating My Nature, I again and again send forth all this multitude of beings, helpless under the force of Nature.Taking hold of My own nature, I again and again send forth this entire host of beings, which is powerless under the control of My nature.With the help of Nature, I again and again pour forth the whole multitude of beings, whether they will or not, for they are ruled by My will.But these actions do not bind Me, O Arjuna, for I remain detached from them, as if I were unconcerned.O Dhananjaya, those actions do not bind Me, for I remain unconcerned and unattached to them.These acts do not bind Me, O Arjuna, sitting as one indifferent, unattached to those acts.O Dhananjaya! These acts do not bind me, remaining as if unconcerned and unattached in these actions.But these acts of mine do not bind me; I remain outside and unattached.Under My supervision, Prakrti gives birth to all mobile and immobile entities, and thus, O Arjuna, the world revolves.Under Me as the supervisor, the Prakrti produces the world of the moving and the non-moving things. Owing to this, O son of Kunti, the world revolves.Under Me, as supervisor, Nature produces the moving and the unmoving; therefore, O Arjuna, the world revolves.O son of Kunti! On account of Me, who remain only as an observer and the prime cause, My nature gives birth to both the moving and the unmoving; hence, this world moves in a circle.Under my guidance, Nature produces all movable and immovable things. Thus, O Arjuna, this universe revolves.Fools disregard Me, dwelling in a human form, not knowing My higher nature as the Supreme Lord of all beings.Not knowing My supreme nature as the Lord of all beings, foolish people disregard Me, who have taken a human form.Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being as the great Lord of all beings.Unaware of My immutable, highest Absolute Supreme nature, the deluded ones disregard Me, dwelling in the human body.Fools disregard Me, seeing Me clad in human form. They do not know that in My higher nature, I am the Lord-God of all.Senseless people have a nature that is deluding and similar to that of rakshasas and asuras. Their hopes are futile, their actions are futile, and their knowledge is futile.Possessed of vain hopes, vain actions, vain knowledge, and senselessness, they become verily possessed of the deceptive disposition of fiends and demons.They are possessed of the deceitful nature of demons and undivine beings, filled with vain hopes, vain actions, and vain knowledge that is senseless.They are of futile aspirations, futile actions, futile knowledge, and wrong intellect; and they take recourse only to the delusive nature that is both demoniac and devilish.Their hopes are futile, their actions worthless, their knowledge ineffective; they are without sense, deceitful, barbaric, and godless.But the great-souled ones, O Arjuna, who are associated with My divine nature, worship Me with an unwavering mind, knowing Me to be the immutable source of all beings.O son of Prtha, the noble ones, being possessed of divine nature, surely adore Me with single-mindedness, knowing Me to be the immutable source of all objects.But the great souls, O Arjuna, partaking of My divine nature, worship Me with a single-minded devotion, knowing Me as the imperishable source of all beings.O son of Prtha! The great-souled men, however, taking hold of the divine nature and having nothing else in their minds, adore Me, viewing Me as the imperishable prime cause of beings.But the great souls, O Arjuna! Filled with my divine spirit, they worship me, fix their minds on me alone, for they know that I am the imperishable source of being.Aspiring for eternal communion with Me, they worship Me, always singing My praises, striving with steadfast resolution and bowing down to Me in devotion.Always glorifying Me and striving, the men of firm vows worship Me by paying obeisance to Me and being ever endowed with devotion.Always glorifying Me, striving, firm in their vows, prostrating themselves before Me, they worship Me with steadfast devotion.Ever speaking of My glory, striving with firm resolve, paying homage to Me, and being permanently endowed with devotion, they worship Me.Always extolling Me, they are strenuous and firm in their vows, prostrating themselves before Me, and worshiping Me continually with concentrated devotion.Others, besides offering the sacrifice of knowledge, also worship Me as One, who is characterized by diversity in countless ways and is multiform (in My Cosmic aspect).Others indeed worship Me by exclusively adoring through the sacrifice of the knowledge of oneness; (others worship Me) in many ways, and (others) as the multiform existing in various forms.Others also, sacrificing with the wisdom-sacrifice, worship Me, the All-Faced, as one, distinct, and manifold.Some worship Me by knowledge-sacrifice, and others by offering sacrifices; thus, they worship Me, the Universally-Faced, either as One or as Many.Others worship Me with full consciousness as the One, the Manifold, the Omnipresent, and the Universal.I am Kratu, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering to the manes, I am the herb, I am the Mantra, I am the clarified butter, I am the fire, I am the oblation.I am the ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am the oblation, I am the medicinal herb, I am the mantra, I am the clarified butter, I am the fire, and I am the act of offering.I am Kratu; I am Yajna; I am the offering to the manes; I am the medicinal herbs and all plants; I am the Mantra; I am also the ghee or melted butter; I am the fire; I am the oblation.I am determination; I am sacrifice; I am Svadha; I am the juice of the herb; I am the Vedic hymn; I am also the clarified butter; I am the sacrificial fire; and I am the act of offering.I am the oblation, the sacrifice, and the worship; I am the fuel and the chant; I am the butter offered to the fire; I am the fire itself, and I am the act of offering.I am the father, mother, creator, and grandfather of the universe; I am the purifier. I am the syllable Om, as well as Rk, Saman, and Yajus.Of this world, I am the father, mother, ordainer, and grandfather; I am the knowable, the sanctifier, the syllable Om, as well as the Rk, Sama, and Yajus.I am the father of this world, the mother, the dispenser of the fruits of actions, and the grandfather; the one thing to be known, the purifier, the sacred monosyllable (Om), and also the Rik, Sama, and Yajur Vedas.I am the father, the mother, the sustainer, and the paternal grandparent of this world; I am the sacred object of knowledge, the syllable Om, the Rk, the Saman, and the Yajus as well.I am the Father of the universe, its Mother, Nourisher, and Grandfather; I am the Knowable and the Pure; I am Om, and I am the Sacred Scriptures.I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the friend. I am the origin, the dissolution, the basis for preservation, and the imperishable seed.I am the fruit of actions, the nourisher, the Lord, witness, abode, refuge, friend, origin, end, foundation, store, and the imperishable seed.I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the shelter, the friend, the origin, the dissolution, the foundation, the treasure-house, and the imperishable seed.I am the method, the nourisher, the lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge, the good-hearted friend, the origin, the dissolution, the sustenance, the repository, and the imperishable seed of the world.I am the goal, the sustainer, the Lord, the witness, the home, the shelter, the lover, and the origin; I am life and death; I am the fountain and the imperishable seed.I give heat, I withhold and send forth the rain; I am immortality and also death, O Arjuna. I am the being and the non-being.O Arjuna, I give heat, I withhold and pour down rain; I am verily the nectar, and also death, existence, and non-existence.As the sun, I give heat; I withhold and send forth the rain; I am immortality and also death, existence and non-existence, O Arjuna.I give heat; I withhold and also send forth rains; I am immortality and also death, the real and the unreal, O Arjuna!I am the heat of the sun, I release and withhold the rain. I am death and immortality; I am being and non-being.Those who are versed in the three Vedas, having been purified from sin by drinking the Soma juice, pray for passage to heaven and worship Me through sacrifices. Reaching the holy realm of the chief of the gods, they enjoy celestial pleasures in heaven.Those who are versed in the Vedas, who drink Soma and are purified of sin, pray for the heavenly goal by worshipping Me through sacrifices. Having reached the place (world) of the king of gods, which is the result of righteousness, they enjoy the divine pleasure of the gods in heaven.The knowers of the three Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, purified of all sins, worshipping Me through sacrifices, pray for the way to heaven; they reach the holy world of the Lord of the gods and enjoy the divine pleasures of the gods in heaven.The masters of the three Vedas, the soma-drinkers, purified of their sins, aspire for the heavenly goal by offering sacrifices to Me. They attain the meritorious world of the Lord of Gods and taste in the heavens the heavenly pleasures of the gods.Those who are versed in the scriptures, who drink the mystic Soma-juice and are purified from sin, and who, while worshipping Me with sacrifices, pray that I will lead them to heaven; they reach the holy world where the Controller of the Powers of Nature resides, and they enjoy the feasts of Paradise.Having enjoyed the spacious world of heaven, they return to the world of mortals, their merit having been exhausted. Thus, those who follow the Vedic rituals and are drawn by desires come and go.After having enjoyed that vast heavenly world, they enter into the human world upon the exhaustion of their merit. Thus, those who follow the rites and duties prescribed in the three Vedas, and are desirous of pleasures, attain the state of coming and going.They, having enjoyed the vast heaven, enter the world of mortals when their merit is exhausted; thus abiding by the injunctions of the three (Vedas) and desiring objects of desires, they attain to the state of coming and going.Having enjoyed that vast world of heaven, they, when their merit is exhausted, enter the world of mortals. Thus, those who long for pleasure and continuously take refuge in the code of conduct prescribed by the Three Vedas, attain the state of going and coming.Yet, although they enjoy the spacious glories of Paradise, when their merit is exhausted, they are born again into this world of mortals. They have followed the letter of the scriptures, yet, because they have sought to fulfill their own desires, they must depart and return again and again.Those who, excluding all else, think of Me and worship Me, aspiring after eternal union with Me, I look after their prosperity and welfare (Yoga and Ksema).Those persons who, becoming non-different from Me and meditating, worship Me everywhere, for them, who are ever attached to Me, I arrange for securing what they lack and preserving what they have.For those men who worship Me alone, thinking of no one else, for those ever-united, I secure what they have not already possessed and preserve what they already possess.Those men who, having nothing else as their goal, worship Me everywhere and are constantly thinking of Me alone; to them, who are fully and constantly attached to Me, I bear acquisition and the security of acquisition.But if a person meditates on Me and Me alone, worships Me always and everywhere, I will take upon Myself the fulfillment of their aspiration, and I will safeguard whatever they attain.Even those who are devoted to other divinities with faith in their hearts, worship Me alone, O Arjuna, though not in accordance with the Sastras.Even those who, being devoted to other deities and endowed with faith, worship them, they also, O son of Kunti, worship Me alone, though following the wrong method.Even those devotees who, endowed with faith, worship other gods, worship Me alone, O Arjuna, but by the wrong method.O son of Kunti! Even those who are devotees of other gods and worship them with faith, worship Me alone, but following non-injunctive practices.Even those who worship the lesser powers, if they do so with faith, they are thereby worshipping Me, though not in the correct manner.For, I am the only enjoyer and the only Lord of all sacrifices. They do not recognize Me in My true nature; hence, they fall.Indeed, I am the enjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices, but they do not know Me truly. Therefore, they fall.For I alone am the enjoyer and Lord of all sacrifices; but they do not know Me in reality, and thus they return to this mortal world.For I am the enjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices, yet they do not recognize Me correctly and thus they turn away.I am the willing recipient of sacrifice, and I am its true Lord. But they do not know me truly, so they fall back.Devotees of gods go to the gods; manes-worshippers go to the manes; worshippers of Bhutas go to the Bhutas; and those who worship Me come to Me.Those who worship the gods reach the gods; the worshippers of the manes go to the manes; the devotees of the Beings reach the Beings; and those who worship Me come to Me.The worshippers of the gods go to them; the ancestor-worshippers go to the manes; the worshippers of the deities who preside over the elements go to them; but My devotees come to Me.The devotees of the gods attain the gods; the devotees of the ancestors attain the ancestors; those who perform sacrifices for the spirits attain the spirits; and those who perform sacrifices for Me attain Me.The votaries of the lesser powers go to them; the devotees of spirits go to them; they who worship the powers of darkness, to such powers shall they go; and so too, those who worship me shall come to me.Whoever offers Me with true devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or some water, I accept this offering made with devotion by them who are pure of heart.Whoever offers Me with devotion—a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water—I accept that gift of the pure-hearted man which has been presented devotionally.Whoever offers Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or a little water, that, so offered devotedly by the pure-minded, I accept.Whoever offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or even a little water with devotion, I accept that offering of devotion from one who has a well-controlled mind.Whatever a person offers to Me, be it a leaf, flower, fruit, or water, I accept it, for it is offered with devotion and a pure mind.Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer, whatever you give away, whatever austerity you practice, O Arjuna, do that as an offering to Me.O son of Kunti, whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as a sacrifice, whatever you give, and whatever austerities you undertake—all of that you offer to Me.Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give, whatever austerity you practice, O Arjuna, do it as an offering to Me.Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever oblation you offer, whatever gift you make, and whatever austerity you perform, O son of Kunti, do that as an offering to Me.Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you sacrifice and give, whatever austerities you practice, do all as an offering to Me.Thus equipped in mind with the Yoga of renunciation, you will free yourself from the bonds of Karma, productive of both auspicious and inauspicious fruits. Thus liberated, you will come to Me.Thus, you will become free from bondage in the form of actions which are productive of good and bad results. Having your mind imbued with the yoga of renunciation and becoming free, you will attain Me.Thus, you shall be freed from the bonds of actions yielding good and evil fruits; with the mind steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation, and liberated, you shall come to Me.Thus, you shall be freed from the good and evil results which are the action-bonds. Having your innate nature immersed in the Yoga of renunciation and, thus, being fully liberated, you shall attain Me.So, your action will have no result, either good or bad; but, through the spirit of renunciation, you will come to Me and be free.I am the same to all creation; there is none hateful or dear to me. But those who worship me with devotion abide in me, and I in them.I am impartial towards all beings; to Me there is none detestable or none dear. But those who worship Me with devotion, they exist in Me, and I too exist in them.I am the same to all beings; there is none hateful or dear to Me; but those who worship Me with devotion are in Me, and I am also in them.I am the same in all beings; none is hateful to Me and none is dear; but whoever worships Me with devotion, they are in Me and I am in them.I am the same to all beings; I do not favour any, nor do I hate any. However, those who worship Me devotedly, they live in Me and I in them.If even the most sinful man worships Me with undivided devotion, he should be regarded as holy, for he has rightly resolved.Even if a man of very bad conduct worships Me with single-minded devotion, he is to be considered truly good; for he has rightly resolved.Even if the most sinful worships Me, with devotion to no one else, he should indeed be regarded as righteous, for he has rightly resolved.Even if an incorrigible evil-doer worships Me, not resorting to any other [goal], he should be deemed to be righteous; for, he has properly undertaken his task.Even the most sinful, if he worships Me with his whole heart, shall be considered righteous, for he is treading the right path.Quickly, he becomes righteous and obtains everlasting peace. Affirm on My behalf, O Arjuna, that My devotee never perishes.He soon becomes possessed of a virtuous mind; he attains everlasting peace. Do you proclaim boldly, O son of Kunti, that My devotee will not be ruined.Soon he becomes righteous and attains eternal peace; O Arjuna, proclaim thou for certain that My devotee never perishes.Quickly he becomes righteous-minded and attains permanent peace. O son of Kunti! I swear that my devotee never gets lost.He will soon attain spirituality and eternal peace. O Arjuna! Believe me, my devotee is never lost.By taking refuge in Me, even those of evil birth, women, Vaisyas, and Sudras, attain the supreme state.For, O son of Prtha, even those who are born of sin-women, Vaisyas, as well as Sudras—[S.'s construction of this portion is: women, Vaisyas as well as Sudras, and even others who are born of sin (i.e., those who are born low and are of vile deeds, viz Mlecchas, Pukkasas and others). M.S. also takes papa-yonayah (born of sin) as a separate phrase, and classifies women and others only as those darred from Vedic study, etc.-Tr.]—even they reach the highest Goal by taking shelter under Me.For, taking refuge in Me, they who, O Arjuna, may be of a sinful birth—women, Vaisyas, and Sudras—attain the Supreme Goal.O son of Prtha, even those who are of sinful birth, women, men of working class, and the members of the fourth caste—even they, having taken refuge in Me, attain the highest goal.Even the children of sinful parents, those miscalled the weaker sex, merchants, and laborers, if they make Me their refuge, they shall attain the highest.How much more then, for the pure Brahmanas and royal sages who are My devotees! Having obtained this transient and joyless world, they should worship Me.What of the holy Brahmanas and devoted, wise sages? Having come to this fleeting, miserable world, worship Me.How much more easily, then, do Brahmins and devoted royal saints attain the goal? Having come to this impermanent and unhappy world, do thou worship Me.Certainly, it should be so in the case of the pious men of the priestly class and devoted royal seers. Having come to this transient and joyless world, you should be devoted to Me.What need is there, then, to mention the holy ministers of God, the devotees, and the saintly rulers? Therefore, do you, born in this changing and miserable world, also worship Me.Focus your mind on Me, be My devotee, worship Me. Bow down to Me. Engaging your mind in this manner and regarding Me as the supreme goal, you will come to Me.Having your mind fixed on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, and bow down to Me. By concentrating your mind and accepting Me as the supreme goal, you shall surely attain Me, who am thus the Self.Fix your mind on Me; be devoted to Me; sacrifice to Me; bow down to Me; having thus united your whole self to Me, taking Me as the supreme goal, you will come to Me.Fix your mind on Me; be devoted to Me; offer sacrifice to Me; pay homage to Me. Thus, having your self fixed and Me as your supreme goal, you will certainly attain Me.Fix your mind on Me, devote yourself to Me, sacrifice for Me, surrender to Me, make Me the object of your aspirations, and you shall assuredly become one with Me, Who am your own Self.The Lord said, "Further, O Arjuna, listen to My Supreme word. Desiring your good, I shall speak to you who loves Me."The Blessed Lord said, O mighty-armed one, listen once more to My supreme utterance, which I, wishing for your welfare, shall speak to you who take delight in it.The Blessed Lord said, Again, O mighty-armed Arjuna, listen to my supreme word which I will declare to you, who are beloved, for your welfare.The Bhagavat said, "O mighty-armed Arjuna! Listen to My best message once more, which I shall declare to you with good intention, for you are dear to Me."Lord Shri Krishna said: Now, O Prince! Listen to My supreme advice, which I give you for the sake of your welfare, for you are My beloved.Neither the host of gods nor the great sages know My power; for I am indeed the source of the gods and the great sages.Neither the gods nor the great sages know My majesty, for I am the source of them all in all respects.Neither the hosts of the gods nor the great sages know My origin; for I am the source of all the gods and the great sages in every way.Neither the hosts of gods nor the great sages know My origin, for I am the first in every respect among the gods and great sages.Neither the professors of divinity nor the great ascetics know My origin, for I am the source from which they all originate.He who knows Me as unborn, without a beginning, and the great Lord of the worlds—he among mortals is undeluded and is released from all sin.He who knows Me—the birthless, beginningless, and great Lord of the worlds—he, the undeluded one among mortals, becomes freed from all sins.He who knows Me as unborn and beginningless, as the great Lord of the worlds, he among mortals is undeluded and is liberated from all sins.Whoever knows Me as the unborn and beginningless Absolute Lord of the universe, that person, not deluded among mortals, is freed from all sins.He who knows Me as the unborn, without beginning, the Lord of the universe, he, stripped of his delusions, becomes free from all conceivable sins.Intelligence, knowledge, non-delusion, forbearance, truth, restraint, self-control, pleasure, pain, exaltation, and depression, fear, and fearlessness;Intelligence, wisdom, non-delusion, forgiveness, truth, control of the external organs, control of the internal organs, happiness, sorrow, birth, death, and fearlessness;Intellect, wisdom, non-delusion, forgiveness, truth, self-restraint, calmness, happiness, pain, existence or birth, non-existence or death, fear, and also fearlessness.Intellect, knowledge, steadiness, patience, truth, control over sense-organs, tranquility of mind, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear, and courage.Intelligence, wisdom, non-delusion, forgiveness, truth, self-control, calmness, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear, and fearlessness;Non-violence, reality, cheerfulness, austerity, beneficence, fame, and infamy—these different qualities of beings arise from Me alone.Non-injury, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame, and infamy—these different dispositions of beings spring from Me alone.Non-injury, equanimity, contentment, austerity, beneficence, fame, and ill-fame—these different qualities of beings arise from Me alone.[Also], non-injury, equanimity, contentment, austerity, charity, repute, and ill-repute—all these diverse dispositions of beings emanate from none other than Me.Harmlessness, equanimity, contentment, austerity, beneficence, fame, and failure—all these characteristics of beings spring from Me alone.The seven great seers of yore, as well as the four Manus, all possessing My mental disposition, were born from My mind. All these creatures of the world are descended from them.The seven great sages, as well as the four Manus of ancient days, from whom all these creatures in the world have descended, had their thoughts fixed on Me, and they were born from My mind.The seven great sages, the ancient four, and the Manus, possessing powers like Mine (due to their minds being fixed on Me), were born from My mind; from them, these creatures have been born in this world.The ancient Seven Great Sages and also the Four Manus, from whom these creatures in this world are offspring—they have been born from My mental dispositions.The seven Great Seers, the progenitors of mankind, the Ancient Four, and the Lawgivers were born of My will and come forth directly from Me. The race of mankind has sprung from them. (Mareechi, Atri, Angira, Pulah, Kratu, Pulastya, Vahishta; the Masters: Sanak, Sanandan, Sanatan, Sanatkumar.)He who truly knows this supreme manifestation and splendor of My auspicious attributes, becomes united with the unshakeable Yoga of Bhakti—there is no doubt of this.One who knows truly this majesty and yoga of Mine, he becomes imbued with unwavering yoga. There is no doubt about it.He who truly knows these manifold manifestations of My Being and this Yoga-power of Mine, becomes established in unshakable Yoga; there is no doubt about it.He who knows correctly this extensively manifesting power and My Yogic power—he is endowed with unwavering Yoga; there is no doubt about it.He who rightly understands My manifested glory and My creative power attains perfect peace without a doubt.I am the origin of all; from me everything proceeds. Thinking thus, the wise worship me with all devotion (Bhava).I am the origin of all; everything moves on due to Me. Realizing this, the wise ones, filled with fervor, adore Me.I am the source of all; from me everything evolves; Understanding this, the wise, endowed with meditation, worship me.'He is the source of all, and from Him all comes forth' - Thus viewing, the wise revere Me with devotion.I am the source of all; from me everything flows. Therefore, the wise worship me with an unchanging devotion.With their minds focused on Me, their pranas centered in Me, inspiring one another and always speaking of Me, they live in contentment and bliss at all times.With their minds fixed on Me, dedicating their lives to Me, enlightening one another, and always speaking of Me, they derive satisfaction and rejoice.With their minds and lives wholly absorbed in Me, they enlighten each other and ever speak of Me, being satisfied and delighted.Having their minds fixed on Me, having their lives gone into Me, enlightening one another, and constantly talking about Me, they are pleased and delighted.With minds concentrated on Me, with lives absorbed in Me, and enlightening one another, they ever feel content and happy.To those who are ceaselessly united with Me and who worship Me with immense love, I lovingly grant that mental disposition (Buddhi-yoga) which leads them to Me.To those who are ever devoted and worship Me with love, I grant the possession of wisdom that leads them to Me.To those who are ever steadfast, worshipping me with love, I give the yoga of discrimination, by which they come to me.To these persons, who thus mingle with Me and revere Me with love, I grant the knowledge-Yoga by which they can reach Me.To those who are always devout and who worship Me with love, I give the power of discrimination that leads them to Me.Out of compassion for them alone, I, abiding in their mental activity as its object, dispel the darkness born of ignorance with the brilliant lamp of knowledge.Out of compassion for them alone, I, residing in their hearts, destroy the darkness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of knowledge.Out of mere compassion for them, I, dwelling within their selves, destroy the darkness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of knowledge.Out of compassion only towards these men, I, who remain as their very Self, destroy with the shining light of wisdom, their darkness born of ignorance.By My grace, I live in their hearts, and I dispel the darkness of ignorance with the shining light of wisdom.Arjuna said, "You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light, and the Supreme Sanctifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal, divine Person, the Primal Lord, the unborn, and all-pervading. So too do the divine sages Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa proclaim. You Yourself also proclaim this."Arjuna said, "You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme Light, the supreme Sanctifier. All the sages, as well as the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa [Although Narada and the other sages are already mentioned by the words 'all the sages', they are still named separately due to their eminence. Asita is the father of Devala.] call You the eternal divine Person, the Primal God, the Birthless, the Omnipresent; and You Yourself indeed tell me this."Arjuna said, "You are the Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode, the supreme purifier, eternal, divine Person, the primeval God, unborn, and omnipresent."Arjuna said, "You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Abode, and the Supreme Purifier. All the seers, as well as the divine seer Narada, Asita Devala, and Vyasa, describe You as the Eternal Divine Soul, the Unborn, and the All-Manifesting First-God. You too have said this to me."Arjuna asked: Thou art the Supreme Spirit, the Eternal Home, the Holiest of Holies, the Eternal Divine Self, the Primal God, the Unborn, and Omnipresent.Arjuna said, "You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light, and the Supreme Sanctifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal, divine Person, the Primal Lord, the unborn, and all-pervading. So too do the divine sages Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa proclaim. You Yourself also proclaim this."Arjuna said, "You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme Light, the supreme Sanctifier. All the sages, as well as the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa [Although Narada and the other sages are already mentioned by the words 'all the sages', they are still named separately due to their eminence. Asita is the father of Devala.] call You the eternal divine Person, the Primal God, the Birthless, the Omnipresent; and You Yourself indeed tell me this."All the sages have thus declared Thee, as also the divine sage Narada; so also Asita, Devala, and Vyasa; and now Thou Thyself dost say so to me.Arjuna said, "You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Abode, and the Supreme Purifier. All the seers, as well as the divine seer Narada, Asita Devala, and Vyasa, describe You as the Eternal Divine Soul, the Unborn, and the All-Manifesting First-God. You too have said this to me."So have said the seers, the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa; and Thou Thyself also sayest it.I deem as true all that you have said to me, O Krishna. Truly, O Lord, neither the gods nor the demons know your manifestation.O Kesava, I accept as true all that You have told me. Certainly, O Lord, neither the gods nor the demons can comprehend Your glory.I believe all that You have said to me to be true, O Krishna; indeed, O blessed Lord!

(No one else can do so.)You alone are capable of fully declaring the auspicious manifesting powers of Yours, through which manifesting power You remain pervading these worlds.Please tell me about all of Your glorious manifestations, through which You pervade the world.How can I, Your devotee, know You by constantly meditating on You? And in what ways, O Lord, should I meditate on You?O Yogi, how shall I know You by remaining ever-engaged in meditation? And through what objects, O Lord, should I meditate on You?How shall I, ever meditating, know you, O Yogin? In what aspects or things, O blessed Lord, should I think of you?O Mighty Yogin! How should I know you, meditating on you? In what various forms, O Bhagavat, should I contemplate you?O Master! How can I, through constant meditation, come to know You? My Lord! What are Your various manifestations through which I can meditate on You?Speak to me again in full, O Krishna, about Your attributes and glories. For I am not sated by hearing Your ambrosial words.O Janardana, please narrate to me again in detail Your own yoga and divine manifestations. For, while hearing Your nectar-like words, I am not satiated.Tell me again in detail, O Krishna, of your yogic power and glory; for I am not satiated with what I have heard of your life-giving and nectar-like speech.In detail, please expound once again Your own Yogic power and the manifesting power. O Janardana! I don't feel contented in hearing Your nectar-like exposition.Tell me again, I pray, of Thy power and Thy glory in full; for I feel that I am never satisfied when I listen to Thy immortal words.The Lord said, "Indeed, I shall tell you, O Arjuna, My auspicious manifestations—those that are most prominent among them. There is no end to their extent."The Blessed Lord said, O best of the Kurus, now, according to their importance, I shall describe to you My own glories, which are indeed divine. There is no end to My manifestations.The Blessed Lord said, "Very well! Now I will declare to you My divine glories in their prominence, O Arjuna; there is no end to their detailed description."The Bhagavat said, "Yes, O best among the Kurus! I shall expound to you only the chief, auspicious manifesting powers of Mine, for there would be no end to My details."Lord Shri Krishna replied: So be it, My beloved friend! I will unfold to you some of the chief aspects of My glory. There is no end to its full extent.I am the Self, O Arjuna, dwelling in the hearts of all beings; I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings.O Gudakesa, I am the Self residing in the hearts of all beings, and I am the beginning, middle, and end of all beings.I am the Self, O Gudakesa, seated in the hearts of all beings; I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings.O conqueror of sleep!

Some are mangled between Thy jaws, with their heads crushed to atoms.As many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, so do these heroes of the world of men enter into Your flaming mouths.As the numerous currents of the waters of rivers rush towards the sea alone, so too do those heroes of the human world enter into Your blazing mouths.Verily, just as many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, so too these heroes in the world of men enter Thy flaming mouths.Just as many water-rapids of the rivers race heading towards the ocean, in the same manner these heroes of the world of men enter into Your mouths, flaming all around.As rivers in flood surge furiously towards the ocean, so these heroes, the greatest among men, fling themselves into Thy flaming mouths.As moths rush swiftly into a blazing fire, leading to their destruction, so do these men swiftly rush into Your mouths, leading to their destruction.As moths hasten with increased speed into a blazing fire for destruction, so too do creatures hasten into Your mouths with increased speed for destruction.As moths hurriedly rush into a blazing fire, leading to their own destruction, so too these creatures hurry into Your mouths, leading to their own destruction.Just as moths, with full speed, enter into the flaming fire for their own destruction, in the same manner the worlds also enter, with full speed, into the mouths of Yours for their own destruction.As moths impetuously fly towards the flame, only to be killed, so these men rush into Your mouths to court their own destruction.Devouring all the worlds on every side with your flaming mouths, you lick them up. Your fiery rays, filling the whole universe with their radiance, scorch it, O Vishnu.You lick Your lips as You devour all creatures from every side with flaming mouths that fill the entire world with heat.Thou lickest up, devouring all the worlds on every side with Thy flaming mouths. Thy fierce rays, filling the whole world with radiance, burn, O Vishnu!Devouring, on all sides with Your blazing mouths, the entire worlds, You are licking up; Your terrible rays scorch the entire universe, filling it with their radiance, O Vishnu!You seem to swallow up the worlds, lapping them in flame. Your glory fills the universe. Your fierce rays beat down upon it irresistibly.Tell me, who are You with this terrible form? Salutations to You, O Supreme God. Be gracious to me. I desire to know You, the Primal One. I do not know Your activities.Tell me who You are, fierce in form. Salutations to You, O Supreme God; be gracious. I desire to fully know You, who are the Prime One. For I do not understand Your actions!Tell me, who you are, so fierce of form. I offer my salutations to you, O God Supreme; have mercy on me. I desire to know you, the original Being. I do not indeed know your workings.Please tell me who You are with a terrible form, O Best of gods! Salutations to You; please be merciful. I am desirous of knowing You, the Primal One, in detail, for I do not clearly comprehend Your actions.Tell me then, who are You, who wears this dreadful form? I bow before You, O Mighty One! Have mercy, I pray, and let me see You as You were at first. I do not know what Your intentions are.The Lord said, "I am the world-destroying Time. Manifesting myself fully, I have begun to destroy the worlds here. Even without you, none of the warriors arrayed in the hostile ranks will survive."The Blessed Lord said, "I am the world-destroying Time, grown in stature and now engaged in annihilating the creatures. Even without you, all the warriors arrayed in the confronting armies will cease to exist!"The Blessed Lord said, "I am the full-grown, world-destroying Time, now engaged in destroying the worlds. Even without you, none of the warriors arrayed in the hostile armies will live."The Bhagavat said, "I am Time, the world-destroyer, engaged here in withdrawing the worlds that are overgrown. Even without you (your fighting), all the warriors standing in the rival armies would cease to be."Lord Shri Krishna replied: I have shown myself to you as the Destroyer who lays waste the world and whose purpose is destruction. In spite of your efforts, all these warriors gathered for battle shall not escape death.Therefore, arise, win glory. Conquering your foes, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. By Me they have already been slain. You be merely an instrument, O Arjuna, you great archer!Therefore, rise up and gain fame; and, defeating the enemies, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. These have been killed by Me even earlier; be you merely an instrument, O Savyasacin (Arjuna).Therefore, stand up and obtain fame. Conquer the enemies and enjoy the unparalleled kingdom. Verily, by Me they have already been slain; be thou a mere instrument, O Arjuna.Therefore, stand up, win glory, and vanquish your foes; enjoy the rich kingdom; for these foes have already been killed by Myself; be a mere token cause in their destruction, O ambidextrous archer!Then gird up your loins and conquer. Subdue your foes and enjoy the kingdom in prosperity. I have already doomed them. Be thou my instrument, Arjuna!Slay Drona, Bhisma, Jayadratha, Karna, as well as other mighty warriors who have been doomed by Me. Do not feel distressed. Fight; you shall conquer your rivals in the battle.You destroy Drona, Bhisma, Jayadratha, Karna, and the other heroic warriors who have been killed by Me. Do not be afraid. Fight! You will conquer the enemies in battle.Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna, and other brave warriors have already been slain by Me; do not be distressed with fear; fight and you shall conquer your enemies in battle.Slay Drona, Bhisma, Jayadratha, and Karna, as well as the other heroes of the world—all already slain by Me. Do not be distressed; fight, and you shall vanquish your enemies in the battle.Drona, Bheeshma, Jayadratha, Karna, and other brave warriors - I have condemned them all. Destroy them; fight without fear. Your foes shall be crushed."Sanjaya said, Having heard this speech of Krsna, Arjuna did Him obeisance; and trembling with awe, he bowed down again, and with folded palms, his voice choked with emotion, he spoke to Krsna.Sanjaya said: Hearing this utterance of Kesava, Kiriti (Arjuna), with joined palms and trembling, prostrated himself, and then, with a faltering voice, bowed down and overcome by fits of fear, said again to Krsna:Sanjaya said, Having heard that speech of Lord Krishna, Arjuna, with joined palms, trembling, prostrated himself, again addressing Krishna in a choked voice, bowing down, overwhelmed with fear.Sanjaya said, On hearing this speech of Kesava, the crowned-prince Arjuna had his palms folded; trembling, he prostrated himself to Krsna; stammering, and very much afraid, he bowed down and spoke to Him again.Sanjaya continued: "Having heard these words from the Lord Shri Krishna, the Prince Arjuna, with folded hands trembling, prostrated himself and with a choked voice, bowing down again and again, and overwhelmed with awe, once more addressed the Lord.Arjuna said, Rightly it is, O Krsna, that Your praise should move the world to joy and love. The rakshasas flee in fear on all sides, and all the hosts of siddhas bow down to You.Arjuna said, "O Hrsikesa, it is proper that the world be delighted and attracted by Your praise; that the Raksasas, stricken with fear, run in all directions; and that all the groups of the Siddhas bow down to You."Arjuna said, "It is fitting, O Krishna, that the world delights and rejoices in Your praise; demons fly in fear in all directions and the hosts of the perfected ones bow to You."Arjuna said, "O Lord of sense-organs (Krsna)! The universe is rightly rejoicing and feeling exceedingly delighted by Your high glory; the demons are fleeing in fear in all directions; and the hosts of the perfected ones are bowing down to You."Arjuna said: My Lord! It is natural for the world to revel and rejoice when singing praises of Your glory; the demons fly in fear and the saints offer You their salutations.(a) And why should they not, O Mahatma, bow down to You who are great, being the first Creator, even of Brahma?
(b) O Infinite, Lord of gods, O You who have the universe as Your abode! You are the imperishable individual self, the existent and the non-existent, and that which is beyond both.And why should they not bow down to You, O exalted One, who are greater than all and who are the first Creator even of Brahma! O infinite One, supreme God, Abode of the Universe, You are the Immutable, being and non-being, and that which is Transcendental.And why should they not, O great Soul, bow to Thee Who art greater than all else, the primal cause even of the Creator (Brahma), O Infinite Being, O Lord of the gods, O Abode of the universe; Thou art the imperishable, the Being, the non-being, and That which is supreme—that which is beyond the Being and the non-being.O Mighty One! Why should they not bow down to You, the Primal Creator, Who is greater than even Brahma (personal god)? O Endless One, O Lord of gods, O Abode of the universe! You are unalterable, existent, non-existent, and also that which is beyond both.How else should they do? O Supreme Self, greater than the powers of creation, the first cause, infinite, the Lord of Lords, the home of the universe, imperishable, being and non-being, yet transcending both.(a) You are the Primal God and the Ancient One. You are the Supreme resting place of the universe...
(b)...You are the Knower and the object of knowledge, and the Supreme Abode. Through You, O infinite of form, is this universe pervaded.You are the primal Deity, the ancient Person; You are the supreme Refuge of this world. You are the knower and the object of knowledge, and the supreme Abode. O You of infinite forms, You pervade the Universe!You are the primal God, the ancient Purusha, the supreme refuge of this universe, the knower, the knowable, and the supreme Abode. Through You, the universe is pervaded, O Being of infinite forms.You are the Primal God; You are the Ancient Soul; You are the transcendent place of rest for this universe; You are the knower and the knowable; You are the Highest Abode; and the universe with its infinite forms is pervaded by You.You are the Primal God, the Ancient One, the Supreme Abode of this universe, the Knower, the Knowledge, and the Final Home. You fill everything. Your form is infinite.(a) You are Yayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, Sashanka, Prajapati, and the great-grandsire.
(b) Hail to You a thousand times! Hail to You again and yet again!You are air, death, fire, the god of the waters, the moon, the Lord of creatures, and the great-grandfather. Salutations to you a thousand times! Salutations to you again and again! Salutations!You are Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the moon, the Creator, and the great-grandfather. I offer my salutations to You a thousand times, and again I offer my salutations to You.You are Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the Moon, Prajapati, and the great-paternal-grandfather; I offer salutations to You a thousand times, and again, even more salutations to You.You are the wind, you are death, you are the fire, the water, the moon, the father, and the grandfather. Honor and glory to you a thousand and a thousand times! Again and again, salutations to you, O my Lord!(a) Salutations to You from before and behind! Salutations to You from all sides, O All!৷৷.

(b) ৷৷. O You of infinite prowess and heroic action, which are measureless! You pervade all beings, and therefore, You are all.Salutations to You in the East and behind. Salutations to You on all sides indeed, O All! You possess infinite strength and infinite heroism. You pervade everything; thus You are all!Salutations to You in front and behind! Salutations to You on every side! O All! You, infinite in power and prowess, pervade all; therefore You are all.Salutations to You in front and behind; salutations to You on all sides, O One Who is All! You are of infinite might and immeasurable power; and You pervade all, and thus You are all.Salutations to Thee in front and on all sides, Thou who encompasseth me round about. Thy power is infinite; Thy majesty immeasurable; Thou upholdest all things; indeed, Thou Thyself art All.Unaware of Your majesty, and either out of negligence or love, or considering You to be a friend, whatever I have said rudely, such as 'O Krsna, O Yadava, O Comrade,'Without knowing Your greatness, whatever I said rashly, inadvertently, or even out of familiarity, thinking You to be a friend, addressing You as 'O Krsna,' 'O Yadava,' 'O friend,' etc.Whatever I have presumptuously said from carelessness or love, addressing You as O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend! regarding You merely as a friend, unknowing of Your greatness.Taking You as a companion, not knowing Your greatness, and out of carelessness or even affection, whatever I have importunately called You—O Krsna, O Yadava, O Comrade—Whatever I have said to you in rashness, taking you only as a friend and addressing you as “O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend!” in thoughtless familiarity, without understanding your greatness;And whatever disrespect has been shown to You in jest, while playing, resting, sitting, or eating, whether alone or in the presence of others, O Acyuta—I implore You for forgiveness, You who are incomprehensible.And that You have been discourteously treated out of fun—while walking, while on a bed, while on a seat, while eating, in privacy, or, O Acyuta, even in public—for that, I beg pardon of You, the incomprehensible One.In whatever way I may have insulted You for the sake of fun, while at play, reposing, sitting, or at meals, when alone (with You), O Krishna, or in company, that I implore You, immeasurable one, to forgive.Whatever disrespect I have shown to You, making fun of You in the course of play, or while on the bed, or on the seat, or at meals, either alone or in the presence of respectable persons—for that, I beg pardon of You, the Unconceivable One, O Acyuta!Whatever insults I have offered to You in jest, in sport, in repose, in conversation, or at a banquet, alone or in a crowd, I ask for Your forgiveness for them all, O You Who are without equal!You are the father of this world, of all that moves and does not move. You are its teacher and the one most worthy of reverence. There is none equal to You. How then could there be in the three worlds another greater than You, O Being of matchless greatness?You are the Father of all beings, both moving and non-moving; to You, the Teacher, are they worthy of worship, and You are greater than a teacher. There is none equal to You; how can there be anyone greater even in all the three worlds, O You of unrivaled power?Thou art the Father of this world, both moving and unmoving. Thou art to be adored by this world; Thou, the greatest Guru; for none exists who is equal to Thee; how then could there be another superior to Thee in the three worlds, O Being of unrivaled power?You are the father of the world of the moving and the unmoving; you are the great preceptor of this universe; in the triad of worlds, there is no one equal to you—how can there be anyone else superior, having greatness not comprehended?For you are the Father of all things movable and immovable, the Worshipful, the Master of Masters! In all the worlds, there is none equal to you; how then could there be one superior, O you who stand alone, Supreme?Therefore, bowing down and prostrating my body, I implore Your mercy, O adorable Lord. As a father listens to his son or a friend to his friend, it is fitting, O Lord, that You, who are dear to me, should bear with me who am dear to You.Therefore, by bowing down and prostrating my body, I seek to propitiate You who are God and are adorable. O Lord, You should forgive my faults as a father would forgive the faults of a son, as a friend would forgive the faults of a friend, and as a lover would forgive the faults of a beloved.Therefore, bowing down and prostrating my body, I crave Thy forgiveness, O adorable Lord. As a father forgives his son, a friend his dear friend, a lover his beloved, even so may Thou forgive me, O God.Hence, paying homage and prostrating my body, I solicit grace from You, the praiseworthy Lord. O God! Be pleased to bear with me, just as a beloved father would with his beloved son, and just as a dear friend would with his dear friend.Therefore, I prostrate myself before You, O Lord! Most Adorable! I salute You, and I ask for Your blessing. Only You can be trusted to bear with me, like a father to a son, like a friend to a friend, and like a lover to his beloved.Seeing something never seen before, I am delighted. But my mind is also filled with awe. Show me, O Lord! Your other form. O Lord of the gods! Be gracious, O Abode of the universe!I am delighted by seeing something I have not seen before, and my mind is stricken with fear. O Lord, show me that very form; O Supreme God, O Abode of the Universe, be gracious!I am delighted, having seen something never seen before; yet my mind is distressed with fear. Show me that form only, O God; have mercy, O God of gods, O Abode of the universe.I am thrilled by what I have not seen before; my mind is greatly distressed with fear; show me Your usual form, O God! Lord of gods! O Abode of the worlds!I rejoice that I have seen what no man has ever seen before; yet, O Lord! I am overwhelmed with fear. Please take on the form I know. Be merciful, O Lord! You who are the home of the entire universe.I wish to see You ever as before, with crown and mace and discus in hand. Assume again that four-armed shape, O Thou the thousand-armed, of Universal Form!I want to see You just as before, wearing a crown, wielding a mace, and holding a disc in hand. O You with a thousand arms, O You of Cosmic form, appear with that very form with four hands.I desire to see You as before, crowned, bearing a mace, with the discus in hand, in Your former form only, having four arms, O thousand-armed, Cosmic Being.I desire to see You in the same manner, wearing a crown, holding the club and the discus in Your hands; please be with the same form having four hands, O Thousand-armed One! O Universal Form!I long to see Thee as Thou wert before, with the crown, the scepter, and the discus in Thy hands; in Thy other form, with Thy four hands, O Thou whose arms are countless and whose forms are infinite.The Lord said, "By My grace, O Arjuna, this Supreme Form, luminous, universal, infinite, and primal—never seen before by anyone but you—has been revealed to you through My own free will."The Blessed Lord said, Out of grace, O Arjuna, this supreme, radiant, cosmic, infinite, primeval form—which no one other than you has seen before—has been shown to you by Me through the power of My own Yoga.The Blessed Lord said, "O Arjuna, this Cosmic Form has graciously been shown to you by Me through My own Yogic power. It is full of splendour, primeval, and infinite; this Cosmic Form of Mine has never been seen before by anyone other than you."The Bhagavat said, "Being gracious towards you, I have shown you, O Arjuna, this supreme form, as a result of your concentration on the Self. This form of Mine, full of universal splendour, unending and primal, has never been seen before by anyone other than yourself."Lord Shri Krishna replied: My beloved friend! It is only through My grace and power that you have been able to see this vision of splendour, the Universal, the Infinite, the Original. Never has it been seen by anyone else.Neither through the study of the Vedas, nor by sacrifices, nor by recitations of the scriptures, nor by gifts, nor by rituals, nor by strict austerities can I be realized in a form like this in the world of men by anyone else but you. O Arjuna!Not by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, not by gifts, not even by rituals, nor by severe austerities, can I, in this form, be perceived in the human world by anyone other than you, O most valiant among the Kurus, who has not received My grace.Neither by the study of the Vedas, nor by gifts, nor by sacrifices, nor by severe austerities, can I be seen in this form in the world of men by any other than yourself, O great hero of the Kurus (Arjuna).Not by the knowledge of the Vedas and sacrifices, nor by making gifts, nor by the rituals, nor by severe austerities, can I be seen in this form in the world of men by anyone other than yourself, O great hero of the Kurus!It is not possible for man on earth to see what thou hast seen, O thou foremost hero of the Kuru-clan, through study of the scriptures, sacrifice or gift, ritual or rigorous austerity!You need not fear any longer, nor be perplexed, looking upon this awe-inspiring form of Mine. Free from fear and with a gladdened heart, behold once again that other form of Mine.May you have no fear, and may there be no bewilderment upon seeing this form of Mine so terrible. Becoming free from fear and gladdened in mind once again, behold this earlier form of Mine.Do not be afraid, nor be bewildered on seeing such a terrible form of Mine; with your fear dispelled and with a gladdened heart, now behold again this former form of Mine.Let there be no distress or bewilderment in you upon seeing this terrifying and violent form of Mine; be free from fear, and with a cheerful heart, behold again this form of Mine which is the same as before.Do not be afraid or confused by the terrible vision. Put away your fear and, with a joyful mind, see Me again in My usual form.Sanjaya said, Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Sri Krsna once more revealed His own form. The Mahatman, assuming a benign form again, reassured him who had been struck with awe.Sanjaya said, Thus, having spoken to Arjuna in that manner, Vasudeva showed His own form again. And He, the exalted One, reassured this terrified one by again becoming serene in his form.Sanjaya said, Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Krishna again showed His own form. The great Soul, assuming His gentle form, then consoled Arjuna, who was terrified.Having said this to Arjuna, Vasudeva revealed His own tiny form; assuming His gentle body once again, the Mighty Soul (Krsna) consoled the frightened Arjuna.Sanjaya continued: "Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Lord Shri Krishna showed Himself again in His accustomed form; and the Mighty Lord, in gentle tones, softly consoled him who had recently trembled with fear.Arjuna said, "Having beheld Your human and pleasing form, O Krsna, I am now composed in mind and have been restored to my normal nature."Arjuna said, "O Janardana, having seen this serene human form of Yours, I have now become calm in mind and restored to my own nature."Arjuna said, "Having seen this Thy gentle human form, O Krishna, now I am composed and have been restored to my own nature."Arjuna said, "On seeing this gentle human form of Yours, O Janardana, I have now regained my nature and collected my thinking faculty."Arjuna said: Seeing You in Your gentle human form, my Lord, I am myself again, calm once more.The Lord said, "It is very hard to behold this form of Mine which you have seen. Even the gods everlong to behold this form."The Blessed Lord said, "This form of Mine, which you have seen, is very difficult to behold; even the gods are ever desirous of a vision of this form."The Blessed Lord said, "It is very hard indeed to see this form of Mine which thou hast seen; even the gods are ever longing to behold it."The Bhagavat said, "This form of Mine, which you have just observed, is extremely difficult to behold; even the gods are ever eager to behold it."Lord Shri Krishna replied: It is difficult to see the vision of Me that thou hast seen. Even the most powerful have longed for it in vain.Sri Krishna says, "I cannot be seen in such a form as You have seen Me, not by the Vedas, nor by austerities, nor by gifts, nor by sacrifice."Not through the Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by gifts, nor even by sacrifice can I be seen in this form as you have seen Me.Neither by the Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by gift, nor by sacrifice can I be seen in this form as thou hast seen Me so easily.Neither by reciting the Vedas, nor by observing austerity, nor by giving gifts, nor by performing sacrifice, can I be seen in this way as you have seen Me now.It is not possible to see Me as you have done through studying the scriptures, performing austerities, giving gifts, or making sacrifices.But by single-minded devotion, O Arjuna, it is possible to truly know, to see, and to enter into Me, who am of this form, O harasser of foes.But, O Arjuna, by single-minded devotion am I, in this form, able to be known and seen in reality, and also entered into, O destroyer of foes.But by single-minded devotion, I can be known, seen, and entered into in reality, O Arjuna.But, through an unwavering devotion, it is possible to know, observe, and even enter into Me, O Arjuna! O scorcher of foes!Only through tireless devotion can I be seen and known; only in this way can a person become one with Me, O Arjuna!Whoever works for Me, regards Me as the highest and is devoted to Me, free from attachment and without animosity towards any creature, they come to Me, O Arjuna.O son of Pandu, he who works for Me, accepts Me as the supreme goal, is devoted to Me, is devoid of attachment and free from enmity towards all beings—he attains Me.He who does all actions for Me, who regards Me as the Supreme, who is devoted to Me, who is free from attachment, who bears no enmity towards any creature, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.He who performs actions for Me, who regards Me as his supreme goal, who is devoted to Me, who is free from attachment, and who is free from hatred towards all beings—he attains Me, O son of Pandu!He who does every action for My sake, to whom I am the final goal, who loves Me alone and hates no one—O My dearest son, only he can realize Me!Arjuna said: Which of these has greater knowledge of yoga—those devotees who meditate on You, ever integrated, or those who meditate on the Imperishable and the Unmanifest?Arjuna said: "Which of these devotees, who are ever dedicated and meditate on You, and those who meditate on the Unmanifested and Immutable, are the best experiencers of yoga [here, yoga means samadhi, spiritual absorption]?"Arjuna said, "Which of them are better versed in Yoga—those who steadfastly worship You, or those who worship the imperishable and the unmanifested?"Arjuna said: Who are the best knowers of yoga, those who are constantly attached to You and worship You, or those who worship the motionless Unmanifest?Arjuna asked, "My Lord, which are the better devotees who worship You: those who try to know You as a Personal God, or those who worship You as Impersonal and Indestructible?"The Lord said, "Those who, ever integrated with Me and possessing supreme faith, worship Me, focusing their minds on Me—these are considered by Me to be the highest among the yogis."The Blessed Lord said, "Those who meditate on Me, fixing their minds on Me with steadfast devotion, endowed with supreme faith—they are considered to be the most perfect yogis according to Me."The Blessed Lord said, "In My opinion, those who fix their minds on Me, worship Me ever steadfastly, and are endowed with supreme faith, are the best in Yoga."The Bhagavat said, "Those who, causing their mind to enter into Me well, remain permanently attached to Me, and are endowed with an extraordinary faith, worship Me—they are considered by Me to be the best among the masters of Yoga."Lord Shri Krishna replied: Those who keep their minds fixed on Me, who worship Me always with unwavering faith and concentration, are the very best.But those who meditate on the Imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, omnipresent, unthinkable, common to all beings, immovable, and constant—Those, however, who meditate in every way on the immutable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, which is all-pervasive, incomprehensible, unchanging, immovable, and constant.Those who worship the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, the omnipresent, the unthinkable, the immovable, and the eternal.Those who contemplate on the Unmanifest, which is motionless, undefinable, all-pervading, unthinkable, peak-like, unmoving, and fixed.Those who worship Me as the Indestructible, the Undefinable, the Omnipresent, the Unthinkable, the Primal, the Immutable, and the Eternal;Having subdued all the senses, being even-minded, and engaged in the welfare of all beings, they too come to Me only.By fully controlling all the organs and remaining even-minded at all times, they, engaged in the welfare of all beings, attain Me alone.Having restrained all the senses, being even-minded everywhere, and intent on the welfare of all beings, they verily come unto Me.Who, by properly restraining the group of sense-organs, remain equanimous at all stages and find pleasure in the welfare of all beings—they attain nothing but Me.Subduing their senses, viewing all conditions of life with an equal eye, and working for the welfare of all beings, they assuredly come to Me.Greater is the difficulty for those whose minds are thus attached to the unmanifest, for the way of the unmanifest is hard to reach for embodied beings.For those whose minds are attached to the Unmanifested, the struggle is greater; for the Goal, which is the Unmanifest, is attained with difficulty by the embodied ones.Greater is their trouble whose minds are set on the unmanifested, for the goal of the unmanifested is very hard for the embodied to reach.But the trouble is much greater for those who have their minds fixed on the Unmanifest, for it is difficult for those with physical bodies to attain the Unmanifest goal.But they who fix their attention on the Absolute and Impersonal encounter greater hardships, for it is difficult for those who have a body to realize Me as without one.For those who dedicate all their actions to Me, hold Me as their supreme goal, are intent on Me, and worship Me, meditating on Me with exclusive devotion;As for those who, having dedicated all actions to Me and accepted Me as the supreme, meditate on Me with single-minded concentration only-.But to those who worship Me, renouncing all actions in Me, regarding Me as the supreme goal, meditating on Me with single-minded yoga.On the other hand, those who, having renounced all their actions in Me, have Me as their sole goal; and revere Me, meditating on Me through that Yoga alone, which admits no other element but Me in it;Verily, those who surrender their actions to Me, who contemplate Me, worship Me, and meditate on Me alone, with no thought other than Me.Those whose minds are thus focused on Me, I soon become their savior from the ocean of mortal life.O son of Prtha, for those who have their minds absorbed in Me, I become, without delay, the deliverer from the sea of the world, which is fraught with death.To those whose minds are set on Me, O Arjuna, verily I soon become the savior out of the ocean of Samsara.Of them, with their minds completely entered into Me, I soon become a redeemer from the ocean of the cycle of death, O son of Prtha!O Arjuna! I rescue them from the ocean of life and death, for their minds are fixed upon Me.Focus your mind on Me alone; and let your intellect enter into Me. Then, you will live in Me alone; there is no doubt.Fix the mind on Me alone; in Me alone let the intellect rest. There is no doubt that hereafter you will dwell in Me alone.Fix your mind on Me, and your intellect in Me. Then you will certainly live in Me alone hereafter.Hence, fix your mind on nothing but Me; cause your thought to settle in Me. Thus, resorting to the best Yoga, you will dwell in Me alone.Then let your mind cling only to Me, let your intellect abide in Me; and without doubt, you will live hereafter in Me alone.If now you are unable to focus your mind on Me, then seek to reach Me, O Arjuna, through the practice of repetition.If, however, you are unable to establish the mind steadily on Me, then, O Dhananjaya, seek to attain Me through the yoga of practice.If you are unable to fix your mind steadily on Me, then seek to reach Me through the yoga of constant practice, O Arjuna.In case you are not able to cause your mind to enter completely into Me, then, O Dhananjaya! Seek to attain Me through the practice of Yoga.But if you cannot fix your mind firmly on Me, then, my beloved friend, try to do so through constant practice.If you are incapable of even this practice of repetition, then devote yourself to My deeds. For even by working for My sake, you will attain perfection.If you are unable even to practice, be intent on works for Me. By undertaking works for Me as well, you will attain perfection. [Identify with Brahman.]If you are unable to practice even this Abhyasa Yoga, be intent on doing actions for My sake; even by doing actions for My sake, you will attain perfection.If you are incapable of doing a steady practice, then have Me as your chief aim in performing actions. Even by performing actions for Me, you shall attain success.And if you are not strong enough to practice concentration, then devote yourself to My service, do all your acts for My sake, and you will still attain the goal.If you are unable to do even this—that is, take refuge in My Yoga—then, with your self-control, renounce the fruits of every action.If you are unable to do even this, then resort to the Yoga for Me and afterwards, control your mind and renounce the results of all your works.If you are unable to do even this, then, resort to union with Me and renounce the fruits of all actions with self-control.Now, if you are not capable of doing this either, then take refuge in My Yoga, renouncing the fruits of all action, with your mind subdued.And if thou art too weak to do even this, then seek refuge in union with Me, and with perfect self-control renounce the fruits of thy actions.Far better is knowledge of the Self than the repeated practice (of remembrance of the Lord). Better is meditation than this knowledge; better is renunciation of the fruits of action than meditation. From such renunciation, peace ensues.Knowledge is certainly superior to practice; meditation surpasses knowledge. The renunciation of the results of works surpasses meditation. From renunciation, peace follows immediately.Better indeed is knowledge than practice; better than knowledge is meditation; better than meditation is the renunciation of the fruits of actions: peace immediately follows renunciation.For, knowledge is superior to practice; due to knowledge, meditation becomes pre-eminent; from meditation arises the renunciation of the fruits of actions; and peace follows renunciation.Knowledge is superior to blind action, meditation is superior to knowledge, renunciation of the fruit of action is superior to meditation, and peace follows from renunciation.He who never hates any being, who is friendly and compassionate, who is free from the feelings of "I" and "mine," who looks upon all pain and pleasure equally, and who is enduring;He who is not hateful towards any creature, who is friendly and compassionate, who has no concept of 'mine' and no sense of egoism, who remains the same in sorrow and happiness, and who is forgiving;He who hates no creature, is friendly and compassionate to all, is free from attachment and egoism, is balanced in pleasure and pain, and is forgiving.He, who is not a hater but a compassionate friend of every being;

Many editions of the Bhagavad Gita do not contain this verse, including the commentary by Shankaracharya. If this verse is included, the total number of verses in the Bhagavad Gita is 701.Arjuna said, "I wish to learn about Nature and the Spirit, the field and the knower of the field, knowledge and that which ought to be known, O Kesava."No translation of this sloka is available.Arjuna asked, "My Lord, who is God, what is Nature, what is Matter, and what is the Self? What is Wisdom, and what is worth knowing? I wish to have this explained."The Lord said, "O Arjuna, this body is called the Field, Ksetra. Those who know the self call the one who knows it the Field-knower, Ksetrajna."The Blessed Lord said, "O son of Kunti, this body is referred to as the 'field'. Those who are versed in this call him who is conscious of it the 'knower of the field'."The Blessed Lord said, "O Arjuna, this body is called the field; he who knows it is called the knower of the field by those who know them."The Bhagavat said, "O son of Kunti! This physical body is called the 'field' (decayer-cum-protector); He who sensitizes it—His knowers call Him properly the 'Field-sensitizer'.Lord Shri Krishna replied: O Arjuna! The body of a person is the playground of the Self; and That which knows the activities of Matter, sages call the Self.And know Me also as the Knower of all Fields, O Arjuna. In My view, the knowledge of the Field and its Knower is the true knowledge.And, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, understand Me to be the 'Knower of the field' in all the fields. In My opinion, that is Knowledge which is the knowledge of the field and the knower of the field.Do thou also know Me as the knower of the field in all fields, O Arjuna. Knowledge of both the field and the knower of the field is considered by Me to be the knowledge.O descendant of Bharata! You should know Me to be the one who sensitizes the fields of all. The knowledge of the field and the one who sensitizes it—that knowledge is, in fact, the understanding of Me.I am the omniscient Self that abides in the realm of matter; knowledge of matter and of the all-knowing Self is wisdom.Listen briefly from Me what the Field is, what it is like, what its modifications are, what purpose it serves, and what it is; as well as who the Self is and what its powers are.Hear from Me in brief about all that, what that field is and how it is; what its changes are, and what causes what effect; and who He is, and what His powers are.Hear from Me in brief what the field is, of what nature it is, what its modifications are, whence it is, who He is, and what His powers are.What is that Field and what is its nature? Why does it undergo modifications, where does it come from, and what is its purpose? Who is the Field-sensitizer and what is His nature? Listen to all this from Me collectively.What is called Matter, of what it is composed, whence it came, and why it changes, what the Self is, and what its power - this I will now briefly set forth.It has been sung by seers in various ways, in various distinctive hymns, and also in the well-reasoned and conclusive words of the Brahma-sutras.It has been sung of in various ways by the Rsis, separately by the different branches of Vedic texts, and also by the rational and convincing sentences themselves which are indicative of and lead to Brahman.Sages have sung in many ways, with various distinctive chants and also with suggestive words indicative of the Absolute, full of reasoning and decisive.This has been sung many times by sages, and also has been clearly decided in the various Vedas in different contexts by means of their words that are suggestive of the Brahman (i.e. in the Upanishads) and are full of reasoning.Seers have sung of it in various ways, in many hymns and sacred Vedic songs, weighty in thought and convincing in their arguments.The great elements, the Ahankara, the Buddhi, the Avyakta, the ten senses, and the one, in addition, the five objects of the senses;The great elements, egoism, intellect, and the Unmanifest itself; the ten organs and the one, and the five objects of the senses;The great elements, egoism, intellect, and also the Unmanifested Nature, the ten senses, and one mind, and the five objects of the senses.The five great elements, egotism, the intellect, the unmanifest, and the ten organs and the five objects of the senses.The five great fundamentals—earth, fire, air, water, and ether—personality, intellect, the mysterious life force, the ten organs of perception and action, the mind, and the five domains of sensation—Desire, hatred, pleasure, and pain, and the combination that constitutes the basis of consciousness—or the individual self—have been briefly described here, along with their modifications.Desire, repulsion, happiness, sorrow, the aggregate (of body and organs), sentience, fortitude—this field, together with its modifications, has been spoken of briefly.Desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the aggregate (body), intelligence, and fortitude—the field has thus been briefly described with its modifications.The desire, the hatred, the pleasure, the pain, the aggregate, the sensibility, and the feeling of satisfaction (or self-find): This, together with its modifications, is collectively called 'the Field'.Desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, sympathy, vitality, and the persistent clinging to life—these are, in brief, the constituents of changing matter.Modesty, absence of ostentation, non-injury, patience, sincerity, service to the preceptor, purity, firmness, and self-restraint;Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forbearance, sincerity, service to the teacher, cleanliness, steadiness, and control of the body and its organs;Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forgiveness, uprightness, service to the teacher, purity, steadfastness, and self-control.Absence of pride, absence of hypocrisy, harmlessness, patience, uprightness, service to the preceptor, purity of mind and body, steadfastness, and self-control.Humility, sincerity, harmlessness, forgiveness, rectitude, service to the Master, purity, steadfastness, and self-control;Absence of desire for sense-objects, and also absence of egotism, the recognition of evil in birth, death, old age, disease, and sorrow;Non-attachment to objects of the senses, and also the absence of egotism; seeing the evil in birth, death, aging, diseases, and miseries;Indifference to the objects of the senses and also absence of egoism; perceiving the evil in birth, death, old age, sickness, and pain.Absence of desire for sense-objects, and also absence of egotism; pondering over the evils of birth, death, old age, sickness, and sorrow;Renouncing the delights of the senses, being without pride, having a right understanding of the painful problem of birth and death, and of age and sickness;Non-attachment, absence of clinging to son, wife, home, and the like, and constant even-mindedness in regard to all desirable and undesirable events;Non-attachment and absence of fondness with regard to sons, wives, homes, etc., and constant equanimity of the mind with regard to the attainment of both the desirable and the undesirable;Non-attachment, non-identification of the Self with son, wife, home, and the rest, and constant even-mindedness in the face of the attainment of both desirable and undesirable.Non-attachment, detachment towards one's children, wives, houses, and the like; and a constant even-mindedness in the occurrence of desirable and undesirable things.Indifference, non-attachment to sex, progeny, or home, equanimity in both good fortune and bad;Constantly devote yourself to Me alone, resort to solitary places, and dislike crowds.And unwavering devotion to Me with single-minded concentration; inclination to retreat to a clean place; lack of delight in a crowd of people;Unswerving devotion to Me through the Yoga of non-separation, resorting to solitary places, and a distaste for the company of people.And an unwavering devotion to Me, with the Yoga of non-duality; taking refuge in a solitary place; disinterest in a crowd of people;Unswerving devotion to Me, with concentration on Me and Me alone, a love for solitude, and indifference to social life;Constant contemplation on the knowledge pertaining to the self, reflection for the attainment of knowledge of the truth—this is declared to be knowledge, and what is contrary to it is ignorance.Steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self, contemplation on the Goal of the knowledge of Reality—this is spoken of as Knowledge. Ignorance is that which is other than this.Constancy in Self-knowledge, the perception of the end of true knowledge—this is declared to be knowledge, and what is opposed to it is ignorance.Constancy in Self-knowledge, and viewing things with the aim of knowing the Reality—all this is declared to be conducive to true knowledge, and what is opposed to this is conducive to wrong knowledge.Constant yearning for the knowledge of the Self, and pondering over the lessons of the great Truth—this is wisdom; all else is ignorance.I shall declare that which is to be known, knowing which one attains the immortal Self. It is beginningless Brahman, having Me as the Highest (Anadi Matparam); it is said to be neither being nor non-being.I shall speak of that which is to be known, by realizing which one attains immortality. The supreme Brahman is without any beginning; that is called neither being nor non-being.I will declare that which is to be known, knowing which one attains immortality; the beginningless Supreme Brahman, which is neither being nor non-being.I shall describe that which is to be known, by knowing which one attains freedom from death: the Supreme Brahman is beginningless and is said to be neither existent nor non-existent.I will now speak to you of that great truth which one ought to know, since by it one will attain immortal bliss—that which is without beginning, the eternal spirit which dwells in me, neither with form nor without it.Its hands and feet are everywhere; Its eyes, heads, and mouths are everywhere; Its ears are on all sides; and It exists, encompassing all things.That Knowable, which has hands and feet everywhere, which has eyes, heads, and mouths everywhere, which has ears everywhere, exists in creatures by pervading them all.With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads, and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere, He exists in the worlds, enveloping all.It has hands and feet of all, has eyes, heads, and faces of all, has ears of all in the world; It envelops all.Everywhere are Its hands and feet; everywhere It has eyes that see, heads that think, and mouths that speak; everywhere It listens; It dwells in all the worlds and envelops them all.Shining by the functions of the senses, yet devoid of the senses, detached yet supporting all, devoid of the Gunas yet experiencing the Gunas;Shining through the functions of all the organs, yet devoid of all the organs; unattached, and verily the supporter of all; without quality, and the perceiver of qualities.Shining by the functions of all the senses, yet without being attached to them; unattached, yet supporting all; devoid of qualities, yet the experiencer of them.It illuminates all the senses; yet it has no sense organs; it is unattached, yet supports all; it is free from the bonds, yet enjoys the bonds.Beyond the senses, it yet shines through every sense perception; bound to nothing, it yet sustains everything; unaffected by the qualities, it still enjoys them all.It is within and without all beings; It is unmoving yet moving; It is so subtle that none can comprehend it; It is far away yet very near.Existing both outside and inside all beings, moving and non-moving, It is incomprehensible due to Its subtlety. It is far away, yet near.It is within and without all beings, both the unmoving and the moving; It is subtle and unknowable, and It is near and far away.It is without and within every being, unmoving yet moving; due to its subtle nature, it is incomprehensible; it exists far away yet is near.It is within all beings, yet outside; motionless yet moving; too subtle to be perceived; far away yet ever near.Undivided yet appearing as if divided among beings, this Self is to be known as the supporter of the elements. It devours them and causes their generation.The Knowable, though undivided, appears to exist as divided in all beings, and It is the sustainer, devourer, and originator of all beings.Undivided yet, It exists as if divided in beings; It is to be known as the supporter of beings; It devours and It generates.It remains undistinguished among the distinguished beings, and appears as if distinguished. It is to be known as the supporter of beings, and also as their swallower and originator.In all beings, undivided yet living in division, it is the upholder of all, both creator and destroyer alike.The light of all lights is said to be beyond Tamas (darkness); it is known to be knowledge, to be attained through knowledge, and to be present in the hearts of all.That is the Light of all lights; It is spoken of as beyond darkness. It is Knowledge, the Knowable, and the Known. It is specially situated in the hearts of all.That Light of all lights is said to be beyond darkness: knowledge, the knowable, and the goal of knowledge, seated in the hearts of all.This is the Light of all lights, stated to be beyond darkness; it is to be known by the above knowledge; it is to be attained only through knowledge; and it distinctly remains in the heart of all.It is the light of lights, beyond the reach of darkness; the wisdom, the only thing worth knowing or that wisdom can teach; the presence in the hearts of all.Thus, the Ksetra, knowledge, and the object of knowledge have been briefly set forth. On knowing this, My devotee becomes fit to attain My state.Thus, in brief, the field, Knowledge, and the Knowable have been spoken of. By understanding this, My devotee becomes qualified for My state.Thus, the field, as well as knowledge and the knowable, have been briefly stated. My devotee, knowing this, enters into My being.This field, as well as the knowledge and what is to be known, are all mentioned collectively; clearly understanding this, My devotee becomes worthy of My state.Thus, I have briefly told you what Matter is, the Self worth realizing, and what Wisdom is. He who is devoted to Me knows, and he will assuredly enter into Me.Know that both Prakṛti and the Self (Puruṣa) are without beginning; know that all modifications and the attributes are born from Prakṛti.Know both Nature and the individual soul to be verily without beginning; know the modifications as well as the qualities to be born of Nature.Know that Nature (matter) and the Spirit are both beginningless, and know also that all modifications and qualities are born from Nature.Both the Material Cause and the Soul are beginningless; you should know this. You should also know that the modifications and strands are born from the Material Cause.Know further that Nature and God have no beginning, and that differences in character and quality originate from Nature only.The Prakṛti is said to be the cause of agency to the body (Kārya) and sense-organs (Karaṇa); the Self is said to be the cause of experiencing pleasure and pain.With regard to the source of the body and its organs, Nature is said to be the cause; the soul is the cause so far as the enjoyment of happiness and sorrow is concerned.In the production of the effect and the cause, Nature (matter) is said to be the cause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the one responsible.In creating the process of cause and effect, the material cause is said to be the basis; and in experiencing pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the basis.Nature is the law that generates cause and effect; God is the source of all pleasure and pain.(a) Indeed, the self seated in Prakrti experiences the Gunas born of Prakrti.
(b) Its attachment to these Gunas is the cause of birth in good and evil wombs.Since the soul is seated in Nature, therefore it experiences the qualities born of Nature. Contact with the qualities is the cause of its births in good and evil wombs.The soul seated in Nature experiences the qualities born of Nature; attachment to the qualities is the cause of its birth in good and evil wombs.For, the soul, seated on the material cause, enjoys the strands born of the material cause; His attachment to the strands is the cause of his births in good and evil wombs.God, dwelling in the heart of Nature, experiences the qualities that Nature brings forth; and His affinity towards these qualities is the reason for His living in a good or evil body.The self in the body is called the spectator, approver, supporter, experiencer, great lord, and supreme self.He who is the Witness, the Permitter, the Sustainer, the Experiencer, the great Lord, and who is also spoken of as the transcendental Self, is the supreme Person in this body.The Supreme Soul in this body is also called the observer, the permitter, the sustainer, the enjoyer, the great Lord, and the Supreme Self.The Supreme Soul in this corporeal body is called the Spectator, the Assenter, the Supporter, the Experiencer, the Mighty Lord, and also the Supreme Self.Thus, in the body of man dwells the Supreme God; He who sees, permits, upholds, and enjoys is the Highest God and the Highest Self.He who understands the Self and Prakriti, along with the Gunas, will not be born again, no matter what state he may be in.He who knows thus the Person, Nature, and Qualities will not be born again, no matter how he may live.He who thus knows the Spirit and Matter together with their qualities, in whatever condition he may be, he is not reborn.He who knows, in this manner, the Soul and the Material Cause together with their strands—he is not reborn, even though he may act in various ways.He who understands God and Nature, along with her qualities, whatever his condition in life may be, will not come back to earth.Some perceive the Self within the self (body) through meditation of the mind, others through Sankhya Yoga, and still others through Karma Yoga.Some realize the Self in their intellect through meditation, others through Sankhya-Yoga, and still others through Karma-Yoga, with the help of the internal organ.Some behold the Self within themselves through meditation, others through the Yoga of knowledge, and still others through the Yoga of action.However, some yogis perceive the Self as the Self within the self through meditation, others through knowledge-yoga, and still others through action-yoga.Some realize the Supreme by meditating, with its aid, on the Self within; others by pure reason; and still others by right action.But some, who do not know this, having heard from others, worship accordingly—these too, devoted to what they hear, pass beyond death.Others, again, who do not know thus, take to thinking after hearing from others; they too, who are devoted to hearing, certainly overcome death.Others, too, who do not know thus, worship, having heard of It from others; they, too, cross beyond death, regarding what they have heard as the supreme refuge.But others, who have no knowledge of this nature, listen from others and reflect [accordingly]; they too, being devoted to what they have heard, do cross over death.Others, again, having no direct knowledge but only hearing from others, still worship, and, if they are true to the teachings, they too will cross the sea of death.Whatever being is born, whether it be moving or stationary, know, O Arjuna, that it is through the combination of the Ksetra (body) and Ksetrajna (knower of the Field).O scion of the Bharata dynasty, whatever object, moving or non-moving, comes into existence, know that to be from the combination of the field and the Knower of the field!Wherever a being is born, whether unmoving or moving, know thou, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), that it is from the union of the field and its knower.Whatever living being is born, stationary or moving, you should know that all this has a close connection with the Field and the Field-sensitizer, O best of the Bharatas!Wherever life is seen in things movable or immovable, it is the result of the combination of Matter and Spirit.Who sees the supreme ruler dwelling alike in all bodies and never perishing, even when they perish, he indeed sees.He who sees the Supreme Lord existing truly in all beings, and the Imperishable among the perishable, sees indeed.He who sees the Supreme Lord existing truly in all beings, the imperishable within the perishable, sees indeed.Whoever perceives the Supreme Lord as abiding and non-perishing in all beings, even as they perish, perceives properly.He who can see the Supreme Lord in all beings, the Imperishable amidst the perishable, he is the one who truly sees.For, seeing the ruler abiding alike in every place, he does not injure himself with his own mind and therefore reaches the highest goal.Since, by truly seeing God, who is present everywhere alike, he does not injure the Self by the Self, he therefore attains the supreme Goal.For he who truly sees the same Lord dwelling everywhere does not destroy the Self by the self; rather, he attains the highest goal.Whoever, perceiving the Lord as abiding in all alike, does not harm themselves by themselves, they attain, on that account, the Supreme Goal.Beholding the Lord equally in all things, his actions do not mar his spiritual life but lead him to the heights of bliss.He who sees that all acts are done universally by Prakrti alone, and likewise that the self is not the doer, he indeed sees.And he who sees actions being done in various ways by Nature itself, and also the Self as the non-agent, he sees.He sees, who sees that all actions are performed solely by Nature and that the Self is without action.Whoever views all actions as being performed (or all objects as being created) by the Material Cause itself, and at the same time views their own Self as a non-performer (or non-creator) - they view properly.He who understands that it is only the Law of Nature that brings action to fruition, and that the Self never acts, alone knows the Truth.When he perceives the independent modes of existence of all beings centered in one, and their expansion from it alone, then he attains Brahman.When one realizes that the state of diversity of living things is rooted in the One, and that their manifestation also comes from That, then one becomes identified with Brahman.When a person sees all beings as resting in the One and emanating from the One alone, they then become Brahman.When he perceives the mutual difference of beings as abiding in One, and its expansion from That alone, at that time he becomes the Brahman.He who sees the diverse forms of life all rooted in One and growing forth from Him, shall indeed find the Absolute.This supreme Self, though dwelling in the body, is immutable, O Arjuna, being without beginning. It neither acts nor is tainted, as it is without Gunas.Being without beginning and without end, O son of Kunti, this immutable, supreme Self does not act, nor is It affected [Also translated as tainted.-Tr.], although It exists in the body.Being without beginning, devoid of any qualities, the Supreme Self, imperishable, though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted.Because this is beginningless, and because this has no qualities, this Supreme Self is changeless and it neither acts nor gets stained [by actions], even though it dwells in the body, O son of Kunti!The Supreme Spirit, O Prince, is without beginning, has no qualities, and is imperishable. Though it is within the body, it does not act, nor is it affected by action.As the all-pervading ether is not tainted due to its subtlety, even so, the self abiding in the body is not tainted everywhere.As the all-pervading space is not defiled, due to its subtlety, similarly the Self, present everywhere in bodies, is not defiled.As the all-pervading ether is not tainted, due to its subtlety, so the Self seated everywhere in the body is not tainted either.Just as the all-pervasive Ether is not stained due to its subtlety, in the same way the Self, abiding in the body everywhere, is not stained.As space, though present everywhere, remains unaffected due to its subtlety, so too the Self, though present in all forms, retains its purity unalloyed.As the one sun illuminates this entire world, so does the Knower of the Field (Ksetrin, the self), O Arjuna, illuminate the entire Field (the body).As the single sun illuminates this entire world, similarly, O descendant of the Bharata dynasty, the Knower of the field illuminates the entire field.Just as the one sun illuminates the entire world, so too does the Lord of the field (Supreme Self) illuminate the entire field, O Arjuna.Just as a single sun illuminates this entire world, so too does the Lord of the Field illuminate the entire Field, O descendant of Bharata!As the one Sun illuminates the entire earth, so the Lord illuminates the entire universe.Those who thus discern, with the eye of knowledge, the difference between the body or the Field (Ksetra) and the knower of the body or Field-knower (Ksetrajna), and the means of deliverance from the manifested Prakrti, they attain the Supreme.Those who, through the eye of wisdom, know the distinction between the field and the Knower of the field, and the annihilation of the Matrix of beings, reach the Supreme.They who, by the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the field and its knower, as well as the liberation from the Nature of being, go to the Supreme.Those who thus understand, with the knowledge-eye, the inner Soul of the Field and the Field-sensitizer, as well as the deliverance from the Material Cause of the elements—they attain the Supreme.Those who, with the eyes of wisdom, thus see the difference between Matter and Spirit, and know how to liberate life from the Law of Nature, attain the Supreme.The Lord said, "I shall declare again another kind of knowledge: It is the best of all forms of knowledge, by knowing which all the sages have attained the state of perfection beyond this world."The Blessed Lord said, "I shall speak again of the supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, by realizing which all the contemplatives have reached the highest perfection from here."The Blessed Lord said, "I will again declare to thee that supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, having known which all the sages have gone to supreme perfection after this life."The Bhagavat said: Further, once again I shall explain the supreme knowledge, the best among knowledges, by knowing which all the seers have gone from here to the Supreme Success.Lord Shri Krishna continued: Now I will reveal to you the wisdom that is beyond knowledge, by attaining which the sages have reached perfection.Resorting to this knowledge, partaking in My Nature, they are not born at the time of creation nor do they suffer at the time of dissolution.Those who attain identity with Me by resorting to this Knowledge are not born even during creation, nor do they suffer pain during dissolution.Those who, having taken refuge in this knowledge, have attained unity with Me, are neither born at the time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution.Holding onto this knowledge, they have attained a state with attributes common to Me; they are neither born at the time of creation nor grieve at the time of dissolution.Dwelling in wisdom and realizing My divinity, they are not reborn when the universe is recreated at the beginning of every cycle, nor are they affected when it is dissolved.My womb is the great Brahman (i.e. Prakṛti). In it, I lay the germ. From that, O Arjuna, comes the birth of all beings.My womb is the great sustainer. In it, I place the seed. From that, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, all things are born.My womb is the great Brahma; in it I place the germ; thence, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings.The mighty Brahman is a womb for Me; and in it I lay seed; from which is the birth of all beings, O descendant of Bharata!The eternal cosmos is My womb, in which I plant the seed from which all beings are born, O prince!Whatever forms are produced in any womb, O Arjuna, the Prakṛti is their great womb, and I am the sowing father.O son of Kunti, whatever forms are born from all the wombs, of them the great sustainer is the womb; I am the father who deposits the seed.Whatever forms are produced, O Arjuna, in any womb whatsoever, the great Brahma is their womb, and I am the seed-giving father.O son of Kunti! Whatever manifestations spring up in all the wombs, the mighty Brahman is the womb, and I am the father who sows the seed.O illustrious son of Kunti! Through whatever wombs men are born, it is the Spirit itself that conceives, and I am their father.The Gunas of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas arise from Prakrti and bind the immutable Self in the body, O Arjuna.O mighty-armed one, the qualities, viz. sattva, rajas, and tamas, born of Nature, are the immutable embodiments belonging to the body.These qualities, O Arjuna, born of Nature, bind fast in the body of the embodied, the indestructible: purity, passion, and inertia.The strands, namely the sattva, rajas, and tamas, born from the prime cause (the said mother), bind the changeless embodied soul to the body, O mighty-armed one!Purity, passion, and ignorance are the qualities that the law of nature brings forth. They fetter the free spirit in all beings.Of these, sattva, being without impurity, is luminous and free from morbidity. It binds, O Arjuna, through attachment to pleasure and knowledge.Among them, sattva, being pure and nirmala (pure-transparent, i.e., capable of resisting any form of ignorance, and hence an illuminator, i.e. a revealer of Consciousness), is harmless. O sinless one, it binds through attachment to happiness and attachment to knowledge.Of these, sattva, which is luminous and healthy due to its stainlessness, binds one by attachment to happiness and knowledge, O sinless one.Among them, the Sattva, being free from impurity, is illuminating and health-giving; and it binds the embodied one with attachment to happiness and also with attachment to knowledge, O sinless one!O Sinless One! Of these, purity, being luminous, strong, and invulnerable, binds one with its yearning for happiness and illumination.Know, O Arjuna, that Rajas is of the nature of passion springing from thirst and attachment. It binds the embodied self with attachment to action.Know rajas to be of the nature of passion, born of hankering and attachment. O son of Kunti, it binds the embodied one through attachment to action.Know, O Arjuna, that Rajas is of the nature of passion, the source of thirst and attachment; it binds fast the embodied one by attachment to action.You should know that Rajas is of the nature of desire and is a source of craving-attachment; and it binds the embodied one by attachment to action, O son of Kunti!Passion, engendered by thirst for pleasure and attachment, binds the soul through its fondness for activities.Know that Tamas is born of false knowledge and deludes all embodied beings. It binds, O Arjuna, with negligence, indolence, and sleep.On the other hand, know tamas, which deludes all embodied beings, to be born of ignorance. O scion of the Bharata dynasty, it binds through inadvertence, laziness, and sleep.But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings; it binds fast, O Arjuna, through heedlessness, indolence, and sleep.But, you should also know that Tamas is born of ignorance and deludes all the Embodied; it binds them with negligence, laziness, and sleep, O descendant of Bharata!But Ignorance, the product of darkness, stupefies the senses of all embodied beings, binding them with chains of folly, indolence, and lethargy.Sattva generates attachment to pleasure, Rajas to action, O Arjuna. But Tamas, obscuring knowledge, generates attachment to negligence.O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva attaches one to happiness, rajas to action, while tamas, obscuring knowledge, leads to inadvertence as well.Sattva attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while Tamas, verily shrouding knowledge, attaches to heedlessness.O descendant of Bharata! The Sattva fully dominates the Embodied in the field of happiness; the Rajas in action; but the Tamas also totally dominates in the field of negligence, by veiling knowledge.Purity brings happiness, passion brings commotion, and ignorance, which obscures wisdom, leads to a life of failure.Prevailing over Rajas and Tamas, Sattva predominates, O Arjuna. Prevailing over Tamas and Sattva, Rajas predominates. Prevailing over Rajas and Sattva, Tamas predominates.O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva increases by subduing rajas and tamas; rajas increases by overpowering sattva and tamas; and tamas increases by dominating over sattva and rajas.Now, O Arjuna, Sattva prevails, having overpowered Rajas and Tamas; then Rajas, having overpowered Sattva and Tamas; and then Tamas, having overpowered Sattva and Rajas.O descendant of Bharata! The Sattva increases by overpowering the Rajas and the Tamas; the Rajas increases by overpowering the Sattva and the Tamas; and the Tamas increases likewise by overpowering the Sattva and the Rajas.O Prince! Purity prevails when passion and ignorance are overcome; passion, when purity and ignorance are overcome; and ignorance when it is overcome by purity and passion.When knowledge, like light, illuminates from all gateways (i.e., the senses), then one should know that Sattva prevails.When the illumination of knowledge radiates through all the doors of the senses in this body, then one should know that sattva has greatly increased.When the wisdom-light shines through every gate of this body, then it may be known that Sattva is predominant.When the knowledge-light arises in all the gates of this body, then one should also know that the Sattva has predominantly increased.When the light of knowledge gleams forth from all the gates of the body, then be sure that purity prevails.Greed, activity, undertaking of work, restlessness, and longing—these arise, O Arjuna, when Rajas predominates.O best of the Bharata dynasty, when rajas becomes predominant, these come into being: avarice, restlessness, undertaking of actions, agitation, and craving.Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, and longing—these arise when Rajas is predominant, O Arjuna.Greed, exertion, undertaking of actions, restlessness, and craving—these are born when Rajas predominates, O chief of the Bharatas!O best of Indians! Avarice, the impulse to act, and the beginning of action itself are all due to the dominance of passion.Non-illumination, inactivity, negligence, and even delusion—these arise, O Arjuna, when Tamas prevails.O descendant of the Kuru dynasty, when tamas predominates, these come into being without exception: non-discrimination, inactivity, inadvertence, and delusion.Darkness, inertia, carelessness, and delusion—these arise when Tamas is predominant, O Arjuna.Absence of mental illumination, lack of exertion, negligence, and mere delusion—these are born when Tamas predominates, O darling of the Kurus!Darkness, stagnation, folly, and infatuation are the results of the dominance of ignorance, O joy of the Kuru clan!If the embodied self dissolves when Sattva prevails, then it proceeds to the pure worlds of those who know the highest.When an embodied one undergoes death while sattva is exclusively predominant, then he attains the untainted worlds of those who know the highest (entities).If the embodied one meets death when Sattva is predominant, then they attain the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest.But if the body-bearer dies when sattva is on the increase, then he attains to the spotless worlds of those who know the highest.When purity prevails, the soul, upon leaving the body, passes on to the pure regions where those who know the Highest reside.(a) When Rajas is prevalent, one meets with dissolution and is born among those attached to work.

(b) Similarly, when Tamas prevails, one who has met with dissolution is born in the womb of beings lacking intelligence.When one dies while rajas predominates, they are born among people attached to activity. Similarly, when one dies while tamas predominates, they take birth among the stupid species.Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in Tamas, he is born in the womb of the thoughtless.By meeting death when Rajas is on the increase, he is born among those who are attached to action; likewise, by meeting death when Tamas is on the increase, he is born in the wombs of the deluded.When passion prevails, the soul is reborn among those who love activity; when ignorance rules, it enters the wombs of the ignorant.It is said that the fruit of a good deed is pure and of the nature of Sattva; the fruit of Rajas is pain; and the fruit of Tamas is ignorance.They say that the result of good work is pure and is born of Sattva. But the result of Rajas is sorrow; the result of Tamas is ignorance.They say that the fruit of good action is Sattvic and pure; indeed, the fruit of Rajas is pain, and the fruit of Tamas is ignorance.It is said that the fruit of good action is spotless and of the Sattva nature; whereas the fruit of Rajas is pain, and the fruit of Tamas is ignorance.They say the fruit of a meritorious action is spotless and pure; the outcome of passion is misery, and of ignorance, darkness.From Sattva arises knowledge, from Rajas arises greed, from Tamas arises negligence and delusion, and from it arises ignorance.From sattva is born knowledge, and from rajas, avarice indeed. From tamas are born inadvertence, delusion, and ignorance, to be sure.From Sattva arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness and delusion arise from Tamas, and also ignorance.From Sattva arises wisdom; from Rajas, only greed; and from Tamas arise negligence, delusion, and ignorance.Purity engenders wisdom, passion avarice, and ignorance folly, infatuation, and darkness.Those who rest in Sattva ascend upwards; those who abide in Rajas stay in the middle; and those, abiding in the tendencies of Tamas descend downwards.People who conform to sattva go higher up; those who conform to rajas stay in the middle; those who conform to tamas, who conform to the actions of the lowest quality, go down.Those seated in Sattva ascend; those of Rajasic nature dwell in the middle; and those of Tamasic nature, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, descend.Those established in Sattva ascend; those given to Rajas remain in the middle; those given to Tamas, established in the tendencies of bad qualities, descend.When purity is in the ascendant, the man evolves; when passion is in the ascendant, he neither evolves nor degenerates; when ignorance is in the ascendant, he is lost.When the seer beholds no agent of action other than the Gunas, and knows what is beyond the Gunas, he attains to My state.When the witness sees none other than the qualities as the agent, and knows that which is superior to the qualities, he attains My nature.When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas and knows that which is higher than them, he attains to My Being.When the Perceiver (the Self) finds no agent other than the Strands, and realizes That which is beyond the Strands, then he attains My state.As soon as one understands that it is only the qualities that act and nothing else, and perceives that which is beyond, they attain My divine nature.The embodied Self, crossing beyond these three Gunas that arise in the body, and being freed from birth, death, aging, and pain, attains immortality.Having transcended these three qualities, which are the origin of the body, the embodied one becomes free from birth, death, old age, and sorrows, and experiences Immortality.The embodied one, having crossed beyond these three Gunas from which the body is evolved, is freed from birth, death, decay, and pain, and attains immortality.Transcending these three strands, from which the body [etc.] is born, the embodied (the soul) is freed from birth, death, old age, and sorrow, and attains immortality.When the soul transcends the Qualities, which are the real cause of physical existence, then, freed from birth and death, from old age and misery, he drinks the nectar of immortality.Arjuna said, "What are the marks of a person who has transcended the three Gunas? What is their behavior? And how do they transcend the three Gunas?"Arjuna said, "O Lord, by what signs is one known who has gone beyond these three qualities? What is their behavior, and how do they transcend these three qualities?"Arjuna said, "What are the marks of one who has transcended the three qualities, O Lord? What is their conduct, and how do they go beyond these three qualities?"Arjuna said, "O Master! With what characteristic marks does he who has transcended these three strands exist? What is his behavior? How does he pass beyond these three strands?"Arjuna asked, "My Lord, how can one recognize someone who has transcended the qualities? How do they act and live beyond them?"The Lord said, "He does not hate illumination, nor activity, nor even delusion, O Arjuna, while these prevail, nor does He long for them when they cease."The Blessed Lord said, "O son of Pandu, he neither dislikes illumination (knowledge), activity, nor delusion when they appear, nor does he long for them when they disappear."The Blessed Lord said, "When light, activity, and delusion are present, he does not hate them, nor does he long for them when they are absent.The Bhagavat said, "O son of Pandu! He neither abhors nor craves for illumination, exertion, and delusion, as and when they arise or cease to be."Lord Shri Krishna replied: O Prince! He who does not shun the quality that is present and does not long for that which is absent;He who sits like one unconcerned, undisturbed by the Gunas; who knows, 'It is the Gunas that are in motion,' and so remains unshaken;He who, sitting like one indifferent, is not distracted by the three qualities; he who, thinking that the qualities alone act, remains firm and does not move surely;He who, seated like one unconcerned, is not moved by the dualities, and who, knowing that the dualities are active, is self-centered and does not move.He who, sitting like an unconcerned person, is not perturbed by the strands; who is ignorant of the existence of the strands; or who remains simply aware that the strands alone exist; who is not shaken;He who maintains an attitude of indifference, who is not disturbed by the qualities, who realizes that it is only they who act, and remains calm;He who is alike in pleasure and pain, who dwells in his Self, who looks upon a clod, a stone, and a piece of gold as of equal value, who remains the same towards things dear and hateful, and who is intelligent, who regards both blame and praise of himself as equal.He to whom sorrow and happiness are alike, who is established in his own Self, to whom a lump of earth, iron, and gold are the same, to whom the agreeable and the disagreeable are the same, who is wise, to whom censure and his own praise are the same;Who is the same in pleasure and pain, who dwells in the Self, to whom a clod of earth, a stone, and gold are all alike, who is the same to the dear and the unfriendly, who is firm, and to whom censure and praise are one and the same.To whom pain, pleasure, and sleep are all the same; to whom a cold, a stone, and a lump of gold are all the same; to whom both the pleasant and unpleasant things are equal; who is firm-minded; to whom blame and personal commendation are equal.Who accepts pain and pleasure as they come, is centered in their Self, to whom a piece of clay, stone, or gold are all the same, who neither likes nor dislikes, who is steadfast, indifferent alike to praise or censure;He who is the same in honor and dishonor, and the same to friend and foe, and who has abandoned all enterprises—he is said to have risen above the Gunas.He who is the same under honor and dishonor, who is equitably disposed towards both friends and foes, who has renounced all undertakings—he is said to have gone beyond dualities.Who is the same in honor and dishonor, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all undertakings, he is said to have transcended the dualities.Who remains equal to honor and dishonor, and equal to the sides of both the friend and the foe; and who has given up all fruits of his actions—he is said to have transcended the bonds.Who looks equally upon honor and dishonor, loves friends and foes alike, and abandons all initiative, such is he who transcends the qualities.And he who, with unwavering devotion through Yoga, serves Me, he, transcending the Gunas, becomes fit for the state of Brahman.And he who serves Me through the unswerving Yoga of Devotion, he, having gone beyond these qualities, qualifies for becoming Brahman.And he who serves Me with unwavering devotion, he, crossing beyond the dualities, is fit for becoming Brahman.Whoever serves me alone with an unwavering devotion to yoga, they will transcend these strands and become Brahman.And he who serves Me alone, with unwavering devotion, shall overcome the Qualities and become one with the Eternal.For I am the ground of Brahman, the immortal, immutable, and eternal Dharma, and perfect bliss.For I am the Abode of Brahman—the indestructible, immutable, eternal, Dharma, and absolute Bliss.For I am the abode of Brahman, the immortal, immutable, and everlasting Dharma, and absolute bliss.'I' am the support for the immortal and changeless Brahman and for its eternal attribute, the unalloyed happiness.For I am the home of the spirit, the continual source of immortality, eternal righteousness, and infinite joy.The Lord said, "They speak of an immutable Asvattha tree with its roots above and branches below; its leaves are the Vedas. He who knows it knows the Vedas."The Blessed Lord said, "They say that the peepul tree, which has its roots upward and its branches downward, and of which the Vedas are the leaves, is imperishable. He who realizes it is a knower of the Vedas."The Blessed Lord said: They (the wise) speak of the indestructible peepul tree, with its roots above and branches below, whose leaves are the meters or hymns; he who knows it is a knower of the Vedas.The Bhagavat said, [The scriptures] speak of a non-perishing holy fig tree, whose roots are high and branches are low, and of which the [Vedic] hymns are the leaves. He who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.Lord Shri Krishna continued: This phenomenal creation, which is both ephemeral and eternal, is like a tree, with its seed above in the Highest and its ramifications below on this earth. The scriptures are its leaves, and he who understands this knows.(a) Its branches extend both above and below, nourished by the Gunas. Their shoots are sense objects. 

(b) And their secondary roots extend downwards, resulting in actions that bind in the world of humans.The branches of that Tree, extending downwards and upwards, are strengthened by the qualities and have sense-objects as their shoots. And the roots, which are followed by actions, spread downwards in the human world [According to A.G. and M.S. manusya-loke means a body distinguished by Brahminhood etc.].Its branches spread below and above, nourished by the Gunas; its buds are sense-objects, and its roots stretch forth below in the world of men, originating action.Of which tree, the branches spreading downward and upward, well-developed with strands, have sense objects as sprouts; and its roots below in the human world, stretching successively, have actions as their sub-knots.Its branches shoot upwards and downwards, deriving their nourishment from the qualities; its buds are the objects of sense; and its roots, which follow the law, causing man's regeneration and degeneration, pierce downwards into the soil.Its form is not perceived here, nor its end, nor its beginning, nor its support. Having cut off this firmly-rooted Asvattha with the strong axe of detachment.Its form is not perceived here in that way; nor its end, nor beginning, nor its continuance. After felling this Peepul tree whose roots are well developed, with the strong sword of detachment.Its form is not perceived here as such, nor its end, origin, foundation, or resting place; having cut asunder this firmly rooted peepul tree with the strong axe of non-attachment.The nature of this is not perceived in that way, nor its end, nor its beginning, nor its center (middle). Cutting this holy fig tree, with its firmly and variedly grown roots, by means of the sharp (or strong) axe of non-attachment;In this world, its true form is not known, neither its origin nor its end, and its strength is not understood—until the tree, with its roots striking deep into the earth, is hewn down by the sharp axe of non-attachment.Then, one should seek that goal, attaining which one never returns. One should seek refuge with that Primal Person from whom this ancient activity streamed forth.Thereafter, that state must be sought, going where they do not return again: I take refuge in that Primeval Person Himself, from whom the eternal Manifestation has ensued.Then, that goal should be sought for, to which, having gone, none returns again. I seek refuge in that Primeval Purusha, from whence streamed forth the ancient activity or energy.Then, that Abode must be sought, having reached which one would not return. The Yogin would attain nothing but that Primal Person, from Whom the old activity (world creation) commences.Beyond lies the path, from which, once found, there is no return. This is the Primal God from whom this ancient creation has sprung.Without the delusion of perverse notions concerning the self, victorious over the evil of attachment, ever devoted to the Self, turned away from desires and liberated from dualities such as pleasure and pain, the undeluded go to that imperishable state.The wise ones, free from pride and non-discrimination, who have conquered the evil of association [hatred and love arising from association with foes and friends], who are ever devoted to spirituality, completely free from desires, and free from the dualities of happiness and sorrow, reach that undecaying state.Free from pride and delusion, victorious over the evil of attachment, dwelling constantly in the Self, their desires having completely turned away, freed from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, they, the undeluded, reach the eternal goal.Those who are rid of pride and delusion, have put down the evils of attachment, remain constantly in their own nature of the Self, have their desires completely departed, and are fully liberated from the pairs known as pleasures and pains—these undeluded men go to that changeless Abode.The wise attain Eternity when, freed from pride and delusion, they have conquered their love for the things of sense; when, renouncing desire and fixing their gaze on the Self, they cease to be tossed to and fro by the opposing sensations, such as pleasure and pain.That supreme light, upon reaching which they do not return any more, is Mine; neither the sun nor the moon nor the fire illuminates It.Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire illuminates That. That is My supreme Abode, to which they do not return.Neither does the sun illuminate there, nor the moon, nor the fire; having gone there, they do not return; that is My supreme abode.The sun does not illuminate That; nor the moon nor the fire; That is My Supreme Abode, having gone to Which they (Yogins) never return.Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor fire shines there. Those who go there never come back. For, O Arjuna, that is my celestial home!An everlasting part of Myself, having become the bound self in the world of life, attracts the senses, of which the mind is the sixth, and which abide in Prakriti.It is indeed a part of Mine that, becoming the eternal individual soul in the region of living beings, draws the organs, which have the mind as their sixth, and which abide in Nature.An eternal portion of Myself having become a living soul in the world of life, draws to itself the five senses, with the mind as the sixth, abiding in Nature.A portion of My own Self, having become the eternal individual Soul in the world of the living beings, draws [into service] the sense organs, of which the sixth is the mind, and which rest in Prakriti.It is only a very small part of My Eternal Self, which is the life of the universe, that draws around itself the six senses, with the mind being the last, which have their source in Nature.Whatever body its lord acquires and from whatever body it departs, it goes on its way, taking these senses as the wind carries scents from their places.When the master leaves it and even when he assumes a body, he departs taking these with him, just as the wind carries away odours from their receptacles.When the Lord, as the individual soul, obtains a body and when He leaves it, He takes these with Him, just as the wind takes the scents from their seats (flowers, etc.).Whatever body He attains to and also from whatever He goes up, the Lord proceeds taking them with Him just as the wind takes odours from their receptacle.When the Supreme Lord enters a body or leaves it, He gathers these senses together and travels with them, as the wind gathers perfume while passing through the flowers.Presiding over the ear, the eye, the sense of touch, the tongue, the nose, and the mind, It experiences these objects of the senses.This one enjoys the objects by presiding over the ears, eyes, skin, tongue, nose, and mind.Presiding over the ears, eyes, touch, taste, smell, and mind, it enjoys the objects of the senses.Presiding over the ear, the eye, the sense of touch, the sense of taste, the sense of smell, and the mind, He enjoys the sense objects.He is the perception of the ear, the eye, the touch, the taste, the smell, and the mind; and the enjoyment of the things they perceive is also His.The deluded do not perceive it conjoined with the Gunas when departing, staying, or experiencing. Those who have the eye of knowledge, however, see it.Persons who are diversely deluded do not see it even when it is leaving, residing, experiencing, or in association with the qualities; those with the eye of knowledge see.The deluded do not see Him who departs, stays, and enjoys; but those who possess the eye of knowledge behold Him.The deluded do not perceive Him; [but] the men of knowledge-eye do see Him, as He dwells, rises up, or enjoys what is endowed with strands.The ignorant do not see that it is He who is present in life and departs at death, or even that it is He who enjoys pleasure through the qualities. Only the eye of wisdom sees this.The striving yogis perceive it established in themselves. But, though striving, those of unrefined minds, devoid of intelligence, do not perceive it.And the diligent yogis see this one existing within themselves. The non-discriminating ones who lack self-control, however, do not see this one, even though they are diligent.The yogis striving for perfection behold Him dwelling in the Self; but, the unrefined and unintelligent, even though striving, do not see Him.The exerting men of Yoga perceive Him dwelling in the Self; [however], the unintelligent men, with their uncontrolled selves, do not perceive Him, even though they exert.The saints, with great effort, find Him within themselves; however, the unintelligent, despite their efforts, cannot control their minds.Know that the brilliance which illumines the whole universe in the sun, the moon, and fire is Mine.That light in the sun which illuminates the whole world, that which is in the moon, and that which is in fire—know that light to be Mine.That light which resides in the sun, illuminating the whole world; that which is in the moon and in the fire—know that light to be Mine.That light which is found in the sun, which is in the moon, and which is also in fire—illuminating the entire world—know that light to be of Mine.Remember that the light which proceeds from the sun, illuminating the whole world, and the light which is in the moon, and that which is in the fire, all are born of me.And, entering the earth, I uphold all beings with My strength. I nourish all herbs, becoming the juicy Soma.And entering the Earth, I sustain the beings through My power; and nourish all the plants by becoming Soma, which is of the nature of sap.Permeating the earth, I support all beings with My energy; and having become the watery moon, I nourish all herbs.And, penetrating the earth, I support all beings with My energy; being the sap-filled moon, I nourish all plants.I enter this world and animate all My creatures with My vitality; and by My cool moonbeams, I nourish the plants.Becoming the digestive fire, I function within the bodies of all living beings. In union with the inward and outward breath, I digest the four kinds of food.Taking the form of Vaisvanara, and residing in the bodies of creatures, I, in association with Prana and Apana, digest the four kinds of food.Having become the fire Vaisvanara, I abide in the bodies of living beings and, associated with the Prana and the Apana, digest the fourfold food.Being the digestive fire dwelling within the bodies of living creatures, and being in association with the upward and downward winds [of the body], I digest the four kinds of food.Becoming the fire of life, I pass into their bodies and, uniting with the vital streams of Prāṇa and Apāna, I digest the various kinds of food.And I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me come memory, knowledge, and their removal too. Indeed, I alone am to be known from all the Vedas. I bring about the fruition of the Vedic rituals; I alone am the knower of the Vedas.And I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me come memory, knowledge, and their loss. I alone am the object to be known through all the Vedas; I am also the originator of the Vedanta, and I Myself am the knower of the Vedas.And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me come memory and knowledge, as well as their absence. I am verily That which has to be known by all the Vedas; I am indeed the author of the Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas.I am entered in the hearts of all; from Me come the faculties of memory, knowledge, and discernment; none but Me is to be known by means of all the Vedas, and I am alone the author of the final part of the Vedas and also the author of the Vedas themselves.I am enthroned in the hearts of all; memory, wisdom, and discrimination owe their origins to Me. I am He Who is to be realized in the scriptures; I inspire their wisdom, and I know their truth.There are two kinds of persons spoken of in the sastra: the perishable (ksara) and the imperishable (aksara). All beings are perishable, while the imperishable is called the unchanging (kutastha).There are two kinds of people in the world: the mutable and the immutable. The mutable consists of all things; the one existing as Maya is referred to as the immutable.Two Purushas there are in this world: the perishable and the imperishable. All beings are perishable, and the Kutastha—the unchanging—is called the imperishable.There are two people in the world: the perishable and the imperishable. The perishable is all elements, and the one that speaks is called the imperishable.There are two aspects in Nature: the perishable and the imperishable. All life in this world belongs to the former, while the unchanging element belongs to the latter.There is a Supreme Person other than these. He is referred to as the Supreme Self (Paramatma) in all the Vedas. He, as the Immutable One and the Lord, enters the threefold world and supports it.But the Supreme Person is different; He is spoken of as the transcendental Self, permeating the three worlds and upholding them, and He is the imperishable God.But distinct is the Supreme Purusha, called the highest Self, indestructible and Lord, who pervades the three worlds and sustains them.But the Highest Person, distinct from both [this], is spoken of as the Supreme Self, which, being the changeless Lord, sustains the triad of the world by entering into it.But I am higher than all, the Supreme God, the Absolute Self, the Eternal Lord, who pervades and upholds all the worlds.Because I transcend the perishable person and am also higher than the imperishable one, therefore I am referred to in the Smrti and the Veda as the Supreme Person (Purusotama).Since I am transcendental to the mutable and above even the immutable, therefore I am well known in the world and in the Vedas as the supreme Person.As I transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, I am declared to be the highest Purusha in the world and in the Vedas.Because I have transcended both the perishable and the imperishable, I am acclaimed in the world and in the Vedas as the highest of persons.I am beyond comparison with the Eternal and the non-eternal; I am known as the Supreme Personality, the Highest God, by scriptures and sages.He who, without delusion, thus knows Me as the Supreme Self, knows all, O Arjuna, and worships Me in every way.O scion of the Bharata dynasty, he who, being free from delusion, knows Me, the supreme Person, thus, is all-knowing and adores Me with his whole being.He who, undeluded, knows Me as the highest Purusha, he, knowing all, worships Me with his whole being (heart), O Arjuna.He who, not being deluded, thus knows Me as the Highest of persons—he knows all and serves Me with his entire being, O descendant of Bharata!He who, with unclouded vision, sees Me as the Lord-God, knows all that there is to be known and will always worship Me with his whole heart.Thus, O sinless one, this most mysterious doctrine has been imparted by Me. By understanding this, one will become truly wise and fulfill their duty.O sinless one, I have thus uttered this most secret scripture. Understanding this, one becomes wise and fulfills their duties, O scion of the Bharata dynasty.Thus, I have imparted to you this most secret science, O sinless one; by knowing this, one becomes wise, and all their duties are accomplished, O Arjuna.Thus, O sinless one, I have imparted to you the most secret scripture; by understanding this, let a man become wise and also become one who has accomplished what needs to be accomplished, O descendant of Bharata!Thus, O sinless one, I have revealed this most mystic knowledge to thee. He who understands it gains wisdom and attains the consummation of life.The Lord said, "Fearlessness, purity of mind, devotion to meditation on the knowledge of the self, alms-giving, self-control, worship, study of the Vedas, austerity, and uprightness—The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purity of mind, persistence in knowledge and yoga, charity, control of the external organs, sacrifice, scriptural study, austerity, and rectitude.The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in knowledge and yoga, almsgiving, control of the senses, sacrifice, study of scriptures, austerity, and straightforwardness.The Bhagavat said: Fearlessness, complete purity of the Sattva, steadfastness in knowledge-Yoga, charity, self-restraint, Vedic sacrifice, recitation of scriptures, austerity, and uprightness.Lord Shri Krishna continued: Fearlessness, clean living, unceasing concentration on wisdom, readiness to give, self-control, a spirit of sacrifice, regular study of the scriptures, austerity, candor,Non-injury, truth, freedom from anger, renunciation, tranquility, non-slandering of others, compassion for all beings, freedom from desire, gentleness, a sense of shame, and freedom from fickleness;Non-injury, truthfulness, absence of anger, renunciation, control of the inner self, absence of vilification, kindness to creatures, non-covetousness, gentleness, modesty, and freedom from restlessness;Harmlessness, truth, absence of anger, renunciation, peacefulness, absence of crookedness, compassion for beings, non-covetousness, gentleness, modesty, and absence of fickleness.Harmlessness, truth, absence of anger, renunciation, absence of attachment, absence of slander, compassion for living beings, and absence of greed, gentleness, modesty, and absence of thoughtlessness;Harmlessness, truth, absence of wrath, renunciation, contentment, straightforwardness, compassion towards all, uncovetousness, courtesy, modesty, and constancy.Grandeur, patience, fortitude, purity, freedom from hatred and over-pride—these, O Arjuna, belong to one who is born to a divine destiny.Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom from malice, absence of haughtiness—these, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, are the qualities of one born destined to have the divine nature.Vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence of pride—these belong to one born for a divine state, O Arjuna.Vital power, forgiveness, fortitude, contentment, absence of treachery, and absence of excessive pride—these are in the person who is born for divine wealth, O Descendant of Bharata!Valor, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom from hate and vanity—these are the qualities of one who possesses the divine, O Arjuna!Pompousness, arrogance, self-conceit, wrath, rudeness, and ignorance—these, O Arjuna, belong to one who is born with a demonic destiny.O son of Prtha, the attributes of one destined to have the demoniacal nature are religious ostentation, pride, haughtiness, self-conceit, anger, rudeness, and ignorance.Hypocrisy, arrogance, and self-conceit, anger, harshness, and ignorance—these belong to one who is born for a demoniacal state, O Partha.Ostentation, arrogance, pride, anger, and harshness, as well as ignorance, are characteristics of a person born of demoniac wealth, O son of Prtha!Hypocrisy, pride, insolence, cruelty, and ignorance belong to those born of godless qualities.The divine destiny is said to lead to liberation, while the demoniac to bondage. Do not grieve, O Arjuna, for you are born with a divine destiny.The divine nature is Liberation, while the demoniacal is considered to be an inevitable bondage. Do not grieve, O son of Pandu! You are destined to possess the divine nature.The divine nature is deemed conducive to liberation, and the demonic to bondage. Grieve not, O Arjuna, for you are born with divine endowments.The divine wealth is meant for total emancipation, and the demoniac one for complete bondage. Grieve not, O son of Pandu, for the divine wealth you are born.Godly qualities lead to liberation; godless ones lead to bondage. Do not be anxious, Prince! You have the Godly qualities.There are two types of beings in this world: the divine and the demoniac. The divine have been described at length. Hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the demoniac.In this world, there are two kinds of creation of beings: the divine and the demoniacal. The divine has been spoken of elaborately. Hear about the demoniacal from Me, O son of Prtha.There are two types of beings in this world: the divine and the demoniacal. The divine has been described at length; hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the demoniacal.There are two types of creations of beings in this world: the divine and the demoniac. The divine one has been described in detail; hear now the demoniac one from Me, O son of Prtha!No changes needed.The demoniacal men neither know action nor renunciation. They have no cleanliness, nor right conduct, nor truth.Neither do the demoniacal persons understand what should be done and what should not be done; nor do they possess purity, good conduct, or truthfulness.The demoniacal do not know what to do and what to refrain from; they have neither purity, nor right conduct, nor truth.The demoniac do not know the origin and the dissolution; neither purity, nor good conduct, nor truth exists in them.The godless do not know how to act or renounce; they lack both purity and truth. They do not understand the right principles of conduct.They maintain: 'The universe is without truth, with no foundation, and without a Lord (Isvara). What else could exist without mutual causation? It has lust as its cause.'They say that the world is unreal, having no basis, and without a God. It is born of mutual union brought about by passion! What other cause could there be?They say, "This universe is without truth, without a moral basis, without a God, brought about by mutual union, with lust as its cause; what else?"They say that this world is without truth; has no basis; and has no Lord; this is not born on the basis of the mutual cause-and-effect-relation [of the things]; it has nothing [beyond] and has no cause.They say the universe is an accident with no purpose and no God. Life is created through sexual union, a product of lust and nothing else.Holding this view, these men of lost souls and feeble understanding do cruel deeds, leading to the destruction of the world.Holding onto this view, those of depraved character, poor intellect, and given to fearful and harmful actions, wax strong and bring ruin to the world.Holding this view, these ruined souls of small intellect and fierce deeds come forth as enemies of the world, intent on its destruction.Clinging to this view, the inauspicious men of ruined souls, poor intellect, and cruel deeds strive to destroy the world.Thinking thus, these degraded souls, these enemies of mankind—whose intelligence is negligible and whose deeds are monstrous—come into the world only to destroy.Turning to insatiable desires, seizing through delusion unjustly acquired wealth, and following impious vows, they act, full of ostentation, pride, and arrogance.Giving themselves up to insatiable passion, filled with vanity, pride, and arrogance, adopting bad adjectives due to delusion, and having impure resolves, they engage in actions.Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride, and arrogance, holding evil ideas due to delusion, they work with impure intentions.Holding to their insatiable desires, being possessed by hypocrisy, avarice, and pride, and holding evil intentions, these cruel men wander with impure resolves.Giving themselves up to insatiable passions, hypocritically, self-sufficiently, and arrogantly, cherishing false conceptions founded on delusion, they work only to carry out their own unholy purposes.Obsessed by unlimited cares that end with dissolution, looking upon the enjoyment of desires as their highest aim, and convinced that this is all;Beset with innumerable cares that end only with death, holding that the enjoyment of desirable objects is the highest goal, they feel sure that this is all.Giving themselves over to immeasurable cares that end only with death, regarding the gratification of lust as their highest aim, and feeling sure that that is all.Adhering to their ultimate and unending anxiety; viewing the gratification of their desires as their highest goal; believing that this is all that exists;Poring anxiously over evil resolutions that only end in death, seeking only the gratification of desire as the highest goal, and seeing nothing beyond—Bound by hundreds of fetters of hopes, given over to desire and anger, they strive unjustly to gather wealth for the gratification of their desires.Bound by hundreds of shackles in the form of hope, giving themselves wholly to passion and anger, they endeavor to amass wealth through foul means for the enjoyment of desirable objects.Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and anger, they strive to obtain hoards of wealth by unlawful means for sensual enjoyment.Bound by hundreds of ropes of longing, devoted to their desire and anger, they seek, by unjust means, hoards of wealth for the gratification of their desires.Caught in the toils of a hundred vain hopes, enslaved by passion and wrath, they accumulate hoards of unjust wealth, only to indulge their sensual desires.'This I have gained today, and this desire I shall attain. This wealth is mine, and this will also be mine hereafter.'I have gained this today; I will acquire this desired object. This is in hand; and this wealth will also come to me.'"I have gained this today; I will fulfill this desire of mine; this is mine, and this wealth will be mine in the future."'I have gained this today; I will attain this object of my desire in the future; this is mine now; and this wealth will also be mine soon.'Today I have gained this; tomorrow I will fulfill another desire; this wealth is mine now, and the rest will soon be mine.'I have slain this enemy, and I shall slay others too. I am the Lord, the enjoyer, the successful one, the strong one, and the happy one.''I have slain that enemy, and I shall slay others too. I am the Lord, the Enjoyer, firmly established, powerful and joyous.'"I have slain that enemy, and I shall slay others too. I am the Lord; I enjoy, I am perfect, powerful, and happy."'I have slain that enemy; and I shall slay others too; I am the Lord; I am a man of pleasure; I am victorious, powerful, and content.'I have slain one enemy; I will slay the others too. I am worthy of enjoying; I am the Almighty, perfect, powerful, and happy.'I am wealthy and high-born; who else is equal to me? I shall sacrifice, I shall give alms, I shall rejoice.' Thus they think, deluded by ignorance.'I am wealthy and of noble birth; who else is like me? I shall perform sacrifices; I shall give, I shall rejoice'- thus, they are deluded by a lack of discernment in diverse ways."I am wealthy and born into a noble family. Who is my equal? I shall perform sacrifices, give charity, and rejoice," thus deluded by ignorance.'I am wealthy; I am of noble birth; who else is equal to me? I shall perform sacrifices; I shall give gifts; and I shall rejoice' - deluded by these wrong ideas;I am wealthy, I am of noble birth; who can compare with me? I will sacrifice, I will give, I will pay—and I will enjoy. Thus blinded by ignorance,Bewildered by numerous thoughts, ensnared in the net of delusion, addicted to sensual pleasures, they fall into a wretched Naraka.Bewildered by numerous thoughts, ensnared in the net of delusion, and engrossed in the enjoyment of desirable objects, they fall into a foul hell.Bewildered by many fancies, entangled in the snare of delusion, addicted to the gratification of lust, they fall into a foul hell.Endowed with many thoughts, highly confused, enslaved by their delusion, and addicted to the gratification of desires, they fall into the hellish and foul.Perplexed by discordant thoughts, entangled in the snares of desire, infatuated by passion, they sink into the depths of hell.Self-conceited, self-sufficient, intoxicated by wealth and pride, they perform sacrifices in name only, ostentatiously and not according to the injunctions of the scriptures.Self-conceited, haughty, filled with pride and intoxicated by wealth, they perform sacrifices that are only in name, ostentatiously and without regard for the injunctions.Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifices in name only for ostentation, contrary to scriptural ordinances.Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with pride and arrogance of wealth, they pretend to perform sacrifices hypocritically, not following the injunctions of the Vedas.Self-conceited, stubborn, wealthy, proud, and insolent, they make a show of their patronage, disregarding the norms of propriety.Depending on their egoism, power, and pride, as well as their desires and wrath, these malicious men hate Me in their own bodies and in those of others.Resorting to egotism, power, arrogance, passion, and anger, hating Me in their own and others' bodies, they become envious by nature.Given over to egoism, power, haughtiness, lust, and anger, these malicious people hate Me in their own bodies and in the bodies of others.Clinging fast to egotism, force, pride, craving, and anger, these envious people hate Me in the bodies of their own and of others.Puffed up by power and inordinate conceit, swayed by lust and wrath, these wicked people hate Me, Who am within them as I am within all.Those who are hateful, cruel, the vilest and most inauspicious of mankind, I hurl forever into the cycles of births and deaths, into the wombs of demons.I cast forever those hateful, cruel, evil-doers in the worlds, the vilest of human beings, verily into the demonic classes.Those cruel haters, the worst among men in the world, I hurl those evil-doers into the wombs of demons only.These hateful, cruel, and base men, I hurl incessantly into the inauspicious, demoniac wombs, alone in the cycle of birth and death.Those who thus hate Me, who are cruel, the dregs of mankind, I condemn them to a continuous, miserable, and godless rebirth.Fallen into demoniac wombs in birth after birth, these deluded men, not attaining Me, further sink down to the lowest level, O Arjuna.Being born among the demoniacal species in birth after birth, the souls, without ever reaching Me, O son of Kunti, attain conditions lower than that.Entering into demoniacal wombs and deluded, birth after birth, they do not attain Me, thus falling, O Arjuna, into a condition still lower than that.Having come to the demoniac womb, birth after birth, and not attaining Me at all, these deluded persons, therefore, pass to the lowest state, O son of Kunti!So, reborn, they spend life after life enveloped in delusion, and they never reach Me, O Prince, but degenerate into even lower forms of life.Desire, wrath, and greed—these are the three gateways to Naraka, ruinous to the self. Therefore, one should abandon these three.This door to hell, which destroys the soul, is of three kinds—passion, anger, and greed. Therefore, one should forsake these three.There are three gates to this hell, destructive of the self: lust, anger, and greed; therefore, one should abandon these three.To the hell, there are three gates that ruin the Self: desire, anger, and greed. Hence, one should avoid these three.The gates of hell are three: lust, wrath, and avarice; they destroy the Self, so avoid them.One who has been released from these three gates of darkness, O Arjuna, works for the benefit of the self; thus, they reach the supreme state.O son of Kunti, a person who is free from these three doors to darkness strives for the good of the soul; thereby, they attain the highest Goal.A person who is liberated from these three gates of darkness, O Arjuna, practices what is beneficial for them and thus goes to the Supreme Goal.O son of Kunti! A man who has deserted these three gates of darkness does what is good for his Self and thereby reaches the highest goal.These are the gates that lead to darkness; if one avoids them, they will ensure their own welfare and eventually attain liberation.He who, abandoning the injunctions of the Sastras, acts under the influence of desire, attains neither perfection nor pleasure, nor the supreme state.Ignoring the precepts of the scriptures, he who acts under the impulse of passion does not attain perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme goal.He who, having cast aside the ordinances of the scriptures, acts under the impulse of desire, does not attain perfection, nor happiness, nor the Supreme Goal.He who neglects the injunctions of the scriptures and acts according to his own will, attains neither success nor happiness nor the highest goal of emancipation.But he who neglects the commands of the scriptures and follows the promptings of passion does not attain perfection, happiness, or the final goal.Therefore, let the Sastra be your authority for determining what should be done and what should not be done. Knowing what is enjoined in the injunctions of the Sastra, you should perform work here.Therefore, the scripture is your authority as regards determining what should be done and what should not be done. After understanding your duty as presented by scriptural injunction, you ought to perform it here.Therefore, let the scripture be thy authority in determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou shouldst act in this world.Therefore, by considering the scripture as your authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done, you should perform actions laid down by the regulations of the scriptures.Therefore, whenever there is doubt as to whether you should do something or not, let the scriptures guide your conduct. In the light of the scriptures, you should labor your whole life.Arjuna said, "Now, O Krsna, what is the position or basis of those who, despite leaving aside the injunction of the Sastra, still worship with faith? Is it Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas?"Arjuna said, But, O Krsna, what is the state of those who, endued with faith, perform sacrifices, distribute wealth, etc. in honour of gods and others, while ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures? Is it sattva, rajas, or tamas?Arjuna said, "What is the condition of those who, disregarding the injunctions of the scriptures, perform sacrifice with faith—is it Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas, O Krishna?"Arjuna said: "What is the state of those who remain faithful but neglect the scriptural injunctions—is it sattva, rajas, or tamas? O Krsna!"Arjuna asked, "My Lord, what is the condition of those who perform acts of sacrifice not according to the scriptures, but with implicit faith? Is it one of purity, passion, or ignorance?"The Lord said, "The faith of embodied beings is threefold, born of their own nature and constituted of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Now, listen to me about it."The Blessed Lord said, "That faith of the embodied beings, born of their own nature, is threefold—born of sattva, rajas, and tamas. Hear about it."The Blessed Lord said, "There are threefold faiths inherent in the nature of the embodied: the sattvic (pure), the rajasic (passionate), and the tamasic (dark). Hear of them."The Bhagavat said, "The faith of the embodied persons is born of their nature and is of three kinds [viz.]: that which is made of Sattva; that which is made of Rajas; and that which is made of Tamas. Listen about them."Lord Shri Krishna replied: Man has an inherent faith in one or another of the qualities—purity, passion, and ignorance. Now, listen.O Arjuna, the faith of everyone is in accordance with their inner organ (Antahkarana). Each person consists of faith; whatever their faith is, that is who they are.O scion of the Bharata dynasty, the faith of all beings is in accordance with their minds. This person is composed of faith as the dominant factor. He is indeed what his faith is.The faith of each is in accordance with their nature, O Arjuna. People consist of their faith; as a person's faith is, so are they.Corresponding to one's own sattva, O descendant of Bharata, everybody has faith. The person predominantly consists of faith. Whatever one has faith in, that he becomes certainly.Every person's faith conforms to their nature. By nature, they are full of faith. They are, in fact, what their faith makes them.The sattvic types worship the gods; the rajasic types worship yaksas and rakshasas; and the others, the tamasic types, worship the departed ancestors and hosts of bhutas.Those with sattva quality worship the gods; those with rajas, the demigods and demons; and those with tamas, ghosts and hosts of spirits.The sattvic, or pure, men worship the gods; the rajasic, or passionate, worship the yakshas and rakshasas; the others, the tamasic or deluded people, worship ghosts and hosts of nature-spirits.The men of the Sattva strand perform sacrifices intending for the gods; the men of the Rajas strand do so for the spirits and demons; and the men of the Tamas strand perform sacrifices intending for the imps, the dead, and the ghosts.The pure worship the true God; the passionate, the powers of wealth and magic; the ignorant, the spirits of the dead and lower orders of nature.Those men who practice terrible austerities not enjoined by the scriptures, given to ostentation and conceit, and prompted by the force of sensual desires and passions;Those persons who, given to ostentation and pride, and possessed of passion, attachment, and strength, undertake severe austerities not sanctioned by the scriptures;Those men who practice terrific austerities not prescribed by the scriptures, given to hypocrisy and egoism, driven by the force of lust and attachment.Those men who practise terrible austerities not as enjoined in the scriptures, who are bound by hypocrisy and conceit, and are impelled by the force of passion for desired objects;Those who practice austerities not commanded by scripture, who are enslaved to hypocrisy and egotism, who are carried away by the fury of desire and passion,These foolish men, who torture the group of elements in their bodies and Me, who dwell within the body—know them to be demoniacal in their resolves.(And those who,) being non-discriminating, torture all the organs in the body as well as even Me who reside in the body—know them to be possessed of demoniacal conviction.Know thou these to be of demonical resolves, senselessly torturing all the elements in the body and Me who dwell in the body.Those who unintelligently emaciate the conglomeration of elements in their physical body and emaciate Me, dwelling within the physical body—know them to be of a demoniac resolve.They are ignorant and torment the organs of the body, harassing Me who lives within. Know that they are devoted to evil.Even the food that is dear to all is threefold; so too are sacrifices, austerities, and gifts. Listen to this distinction among them.Food, which is dear to all, is of three kinds; likewise, sacrifices, austerity, and charity are also of three kinds. Listen to this classification of them.The food that is dear to each is threefold, as well as sacrifice, austerity, and almsgiving. Hear the distinction of these.Further, the food which is dear to all is of three kinds. So too are their sacrifice, austerity, and charity. Listen to this distinction of them.The food that people enjoy is also threefold, like the ways of sacrifice, austerity, and almsgiving. Listen to the distinction.Foods that promote longevity, intellectual alertness, strength, health, pleasure, and happiness, and those that are sweet, oily, substantial, and agreeable, are dear to sattvic men.Foods that augment life, firmness of mind, strength, health, happiness, and delight, and which are succulent, oleaginous, substantial, and agreeable, are dear to one endowed with sattva.The foods that increase life, purity, strength, health, joy, and cheerfulness (good appetite), which are savory, oily, substantial, and agreeable, are dear to the Sattvic (pure) people.The foods that increase life, energy, strength, good health, happiness, and satisfaction; which are delicious, soft, substantial, and pleasant to the heart (stomach); they are dear to the men of the Sattva strand.The foods that prolong life, increase purity, vigour, health, cheerfulness, and happiness are those that are delicious, soothing, substantial, and agreeable; these are loved by the pure.Foods that are bitter, sour, very salty, excessively heating, highly pungent, dry, and burning are all dear to Rajasika men; they cause pain, sorrow, and disease.Foods that are bitter, sour, salty, very hot, pungent, dry, and burning, producing pain, sorrow, and disease, are dear to one who has rajas.The foods that are bitter, sour, salty, overly hot, pungent, dry, and burning are liked by the Rajasic and are productive of pain, grief, and disease.The foods killed by men of the Rajas strand are those that are bitter, sour, salty, very hot, harsh, dry, and burning; and which cause pain, grief, and disease.Those in whom passion is dominant like foods that are bitter, sour, salty, overly hot, pungent, dry, and burning. These produce unhappiness, repentance, and disease.That food which is stale, tasteless, putrid, decayed, rejected, unclean, is dear to those of a Tamasic nature.Food that is not properly cooked, lacking in essence, putrid and stale, as well as that which is unfit for sacrifice, is dear to one possessed of tamas.That which is stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, rejected, and impure is the food liked by the Tamasic.What is old, tasteless, foul-smelling, and stale; what is also left over after eating, and is impure - such food is dear to the men of Tamas (Strand).The ignorant love food that is stale, not nourishing, putrid, and corrupt; the leftovers of others, and unclean.The sacrifice (worship) marked by Sattva is what is offered by those who desire no fruit and have the conviction that it should be performed as prescribed in the scriptures.That sacrifice which is in accordance with the injunctions, performed by persons who do not hanker after results, and with the mental conviction that it is surely obligatory, is done through sattva.That sacrifice which is offered by men without desire for reward, as enjoined by the ordinance (scripture), with a firm faith that doing so is their duty, is Sattvic or pure.That sacrifice of the Sattva (Strand) is offered, as prescribed, by those who desire no reward, steadying their minds with the thought that it is simply something to be offered.Sacrifice is pure when it is offered by one who does not covet the fruit of it, when it is done according to the commands of scripture, and with implicit faith that the sacrifice is a duty.But that sacrifice which is offered with the intention of gaining a reward and for the sake of show, know it, O Arjuna, to be Rajasic.But that sacrifice which is performed with an aim for a result, as well as for show—know that sacrifice to be done through rajas, O greatest among the descendants of Bharata.The sacrifice that is offered, O Arjuna, seeking a reward and for show, know that to be a Rajasic Yajna.What is offered aiming at fruit and also only for the sake of display—know that sacrifice to be of the Rajas strand and to be transitory and impermanent.Sacrifice which is performed for the sake of its results, or for self-glorification - that, O best of Aryans, is the product of passion.That sacrifice which is devoid of authority, which uses offerings not sanctioned by the Sastras, which is performed without recitation of hymns and devoid of gifts and faith - that, they say, is marked by Tamas.They declare that sacrifice as 'done through tamas' which is contrary to injunction, in which no food is distributed, in which no mantras are used, in which no offerings are made to priests, and which is devoid of faith.They declare that sacrifice to be Tamasic which is contrary to the ordinances of the scriptures, in which no food is distributed, and which is devoid of mantras, gifts, and faith.They declare that sacrifice to be of the Tamas (Strand) which is devoid of scriptural injunction, in which there is no recitation of Vedic hymns, where no food and sacrificial fee are distributed, and which is completely devoid of faith.Sacrifice that is contrary to scriptural command, that is unaccompanied by prayers or gifts of food or money, and is without faith—that is the product of ignorance.Worshiping the gods, the twice-born, the preceptors, the enlightened ones, practicing purity, uprightness, continence, and non-injury—these are called austerity of the body.The worship of gods, twice-borns, venerable persons, and the wise; purity, straightforwardness, celibacy, and non-injury—these are said to be bodily austerities.Worship of the gods, the twice-born, the teachers, and the wise; purity, straightforwardness, celibacy, and non-injury are all called the austerities of the body.The worship of the gods, the twice-born, the elders, and the wise; purity, honesty, continence, and harmlessness—all this is said to be bodily austerity.Worship of God and the Master; respect for the preacher and the philosopher; purity, rectitude, continence, and harmlessness—all of these constitute physical austerity.Speech that causes no shock, is true, pleasant, and beneficial, and also the practice of reciting scriptures, is called the austerity of speech.That speech which causes no pain, which is true, agreeable, and beneficial; as well as the practice of studying the scriptures—is said to be the austerity of speech.Speech that causes no excitement, is truthful, pleasant, and beneficial; the practice of studying the Vedas is called austerity of speech.The unoffending speech which is true, pleasant, and beneficial; as well as the practice of regular recitation of the Vedas—all this is said to be an austerity of the speech-sense.Speech that hurts no one, that is true, pleasant to listen to, and beneficial, and the constant study of the scriptures—this is austerity of speech.Serenity of mind, benevolence, silence, self-control, and purity of mind—these are known as austerity of the mind.Tranquility of mind, gentleness, reticence, withdrawal of the mind, purity of heart—these are what are called mental austerities.Serenity of mind, good-heartedness, self-control, and purity of nature—this is called mental austerity.The serenity of mind, the stillness, the taciturnity, the self-control, the purity of thought—all this is called mental austerity.Serenity, kindness, silence, self-control, and purity—these are the austerities of the mind.The threefold austerity, practiced with supreme faith by men who desire no fruit and are devoted—they call it austerity of Sattva.When that threefold austerity is undertaken with supreme faith by people who do not hanker after results and are self-controlled, they speak of it as being born of sattva.This threefold austerity, practiced by steadfast men, with the utmost faith, desiring no reward, is called Sattvic.This three-fold austerity, observed with best faith, by men who are masters of Yoga and have no desire for its fruits—they call it to be of the Sattva.These threefold austerities, performed with faith and without thought of reward, can truly be considered pure.That austerity, practiced with ostentation for the sake of gaining respect, praise, and reverence, is here said to be Rajasa. It is unsteady and impermanent.That austerity which is undertaken for earning a name, being honored and worshipped, and also ostentatiously—that is spoken of as born of rajas, belonging to this world, uncertain, and transitory.The austerity that is practiced with the aim of gaining good reception, honor, and worship, and with hypocrisy, is said to be Rajasic, unstable, and transient.The austerity that is practiced for gaining respect, honor, and reverence, and with sheer show—that is called here [austerity] of the Rajas, and it is unstable and impermanent.Austerity coupled with hypocrisy, or performed for the sake of self-glorification, popularity, or vanity, comes from passion, and its result is always uncertain and temporary.That austerity which is practised from deluded notions by means of self-torture or to injure another is said to be Tamasika.That austerity which is undertaken with a foolish intent, causing pain to oneself or for the destruction of others, is said to be born of tamas.That austerity which is practised out of a foolish notion, with self-torture, or for the purpose of destroying another, is declared to be of the Tamasic nature.What austerity is practised with foolish obstinacy and self-torture only in order to destroy others—that is declared to be of the Tamas.Austerity done under delusion, and accompanied with sorcery or the infliction of pain upon oneself or another, may be assumed to spring from ignorance.Gifts given with the feeling that it is one's own duty to give, to one who makes no return, at the proper place and time to the deserving person—that is said to be sattvika.That gift is referred to as born of sattva which is given with the idea that it should be given, to one who will not serve in return, at the right place, right time, and to the right person.That gift which is given to one who does nothing in return, knowing it to be a duty to give in a suitable place and time to a worthy person, is held to be Sattvic.A gift that is given with the thought that 'one must give' and is given in an appropriate place and at the right time to a worthy person who is unable to repay—that gift is considered to be of the Sattva.The gift that is given without thought of recompense, believing it should be made, in an appropriate place, at an opportune time, and to a deserving person—such a gift is pure.But that which is given as a consideration for something received or in expectation of a future reward, or grudgingly, is called a Rajasika gift.But the gift which is given expecting reciprocation, or with a desire for its result, and grudgingly, is considered to be born of rajas.And, that gift which is given with the intention of receiving something in return, or expecting a reward, or begrudgingly, is considered to be Rajasic.But what is given in return for a favor, or with the expectation of a reward, and which is done with much agitation—that gift is said to be of the Rajas.That which is given for the sake of the results it will produce, or with the hope of recompense, or grudgingly—that may truly be said to be the outcome of passion.That gift which is given at the wrong place, wrong time, to an unworthy recipient, without due respect and with contempt, is called the gift of a Tamasa nature.The gift which is made at an inappropriate place and time, and to undeserving persons, without proper respect and with disdain, is declared to be born of tamas.The gift that is given in the wrong place and at the wrong time, to unworthy persons, without respect or with insult, is declared to be of a Tamasic nature.The gift which is given at an inappropriate place, time, and to unworthy persons, and which is converted into a bad act and is disrespected—that is declared to be of the Tamas.And that which is given at an inappropriate place or time or to one who is undeserving, or with disrespect or contempt - such a gift is the result of ignorance.Om, Tat, Sat—thus, Brahman is denoted by this threefold expression. In the past, Brahmanas, the Vedas, and sacrifices were ordained in association with these."Om-tat-sat" - this is considered to be the threefold designation of Brahman. The Brahmanas, Vedas, and sacrifices were ordained by that in days of yore."Om Tat Sat": This has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman. By that, the Brahmanas, the Vedas, and the sacrifices were created formerly.OM TAT SAT: This is held to be the three-fold indication of Brahman. Through this, the Vedas and sacrifices were fashioned by Brahma in the past.Om Tat Sat is the triple designation of the Eternal Spirit, by which the Vedic Scriptures, ceremonials, and sacrifices were ordained of old.Therefore, the Veda-enjoined sacrificial acts, gifts, and austerities, expounded by the Vedas, or those belonging to the first three stations, are always begun after pronouncing Om at the beginning.Therefore, acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity, as prescribed through injunctions, of those who study and expound the Vedas, always commence after uttering the syllable ‘Om’.Therefore, with the utterance of "Om," the acts of sacrifice, gift, and austerity, as enjoined in the scriptures, are always begun by the students of Brahman.Therefore, the scripture-prescribed acts of sacrifice, gift, and austerity of those who are habituated to having Brahman-discourses invariably commence with the utterance of OM.Therefore, all acts of sacrifice, gifts, and austerities prescribed by the scriptures are always begun by those who understand the Spirit with the word "Om."Acts of sacrifice, austerity, and various gifts are performed without aiming at a reward by those who seek release, after pronouncing Tat.After uttering the word "tat," acts of sacrifice and austerity, as well as various acts of charity, are performed without regard for results by persons aspiring for liberation.Uttering "Tat," without aiming for the fruits, are the acts of sacrifice, austerity, and the various acts of gifts performed by those seeking liberation.With the utterance of TAT, and without aiming for the fruit, those who seek emancipation perform acts of sacrifice, austerity, and various acts of giving.Those who desire deliverance begin their acts of sacrifice, austerity, or gift with the word "Tat" (meaning "That"), without thought of reward.This term "Sat" is used in the sense of existence and goodness. And so also, O Arjuna, the word "Sat" is applied to an auspicious action.This word "sat" is used with regard to something coming into being and someone becoming good. Likewise, O son of Prtha, the word "sat" is used with regard to an auspicious rite.The word "Sat" is used to refer to reality and goodness; likewise, O Arjuna, the word "Sat" is used to refer to an auspicious act.In the sense of 'right' (or 'manifesting as being') and in the sense of 'proper' (or 'manifesting perfectly'), this word SAT is employed. Likewise, the word SAT is used with regard to the praiseworthy act; O son of Prtha!Sat' means Reality or the highest Good, and also, O Arjuna, it is used to denote an action of exceptional merit.Devotion to sacrifice, austerity, and gifts is also referred to as Sat; and thus, any action for such purposes is known as Sat.And the steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity, and charity is spoken of as sat (good). And even the action meant for these is, indeed, called as sat.Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity, and gift is also called 'Sat', and action in connection with these, or for the sake of the Supreme, is also called 'Sat'.Steadfastness is performing sacrifice, austerity, and giving gifts; this act is hence justly called SAT.Conviction in sacrifice, austerity, and giving is also called Sat. So too, an action done only for the Lord's sake.Whatever offering or gift is made, whatever austerity is practiced, and whatever action is performed without faith, that is called Asat, O Arjuna. It is of no value here or hereafter.O son of Prtha, whatever is offered in sacrifice and given in charity, as also whatever austerity is undertaken or whatever is done without faith, is said to be of no avail. And it is of no consequence after death, nor here.Whatever is sacrificed, given, or performed, and whatever austerity is practiced without faith, it is called 'Asat', O Arjuna; it is of no value here or hereafter (after death).Without faith, whatever oblation is offered, whatever gift is made, whatever austerity is practiced, and whatever action is undertaken, that is called ASAT and it is of no avail after one's death or in this world.Whatever is done without faith, whether it be sacrifice, austerity, gift, or anything else, is called Asat (meaning "Unreal"), for it is the negation of Sat, O Arjuna! Such an act has no significance, here or hereafter.Arjuna said, "I desire to know the truth about renunciation and abnegation separately, O Krishna."Arjuna said, O mighty-armed Hrsikesa, O slayer of Kesi, I want to know separately the truth about sannyasa as well as about tyaga.Arjuna said, "O mighty-armed Hrishikesa, I desire to know the essence or truth of renunciation and abandonment severally, O slayer of Kesi."Arjuna said, O Mighty-armed One! I desire to know, in detail, the distinctive nature of renunciation and relinquishment, O Hrsikesa! O Slayer of Kesin!Arjuna asked, "O Mighty One! I desire to know how relinquishment is distinguished from renunciation.The Lord said, "The sages hold that Sannyasa is the giving up of all works motivated by desire, and the wise declare Tyaga to be the abandonment of the fruits of all works.The Blessed Lord said, "The learned ones know sannyasa to be the giving up of actions done with a desire for reward. The adepts call the abandonment of the results of all works 'tyaga'."The Blessed Lord said, "The sages understand sannyasa to be the renunciation of action with desire; the wise declare the abandonment of the fruits of all actions to be tyaga."The Bhagavat said, "The seers understand the act of renouncing desire-motivated actions as renunciation; the experts declare the relinquishment of the fruits of all actions to be relinquishment."Lord Shri Krishna replied: The sages say that renunciation is forgoing an action that springs from desire, and relinquishing is the surrender of its fruit.Some sages say that all actions should be abandoned as evil; others declare that works such as sacrifices, gifts, and austerities should not be abandoned.Some learned persons say that action, beset with evil as it is, should be abandoned, and others say that the practice of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned.Some philosophers declare that actions should be abandoned as evil; while others declare that acts of sacrifice, gift, and austerity should not be relinquished.Certain wise men declare that the harmful action should be relinquished, while others say that the actions of performing sacrifices, giving gifts, and observing austerities should not be relinquished.Some philosophers say that all action is evil and should be abandoned, whereas others maintain that acts of sacrifice, benevolence, and austerity should not be given up.Listen to My decision, O Arjuna, concerning abandonment; for abandonment is declared to be of three kinds.O the most excellent among the descendants of Bharata, hear from Me the firm conclusion regarding that tyaga. For, O greatest among men, tyaga has been clearly declared to be of three kinds.Hear from Me the conclusion or the final truth about this abandonment, O best of the Bharatas; abandonment, indeed, O best of men, has been declared to be of three kinds.O best of Bharata's descendants! Listen to My considered view about relinquishing: Indeed, the act of relinquishing is rightly spoken to be threefold, O best among men!O best of Indians! Listen to my judgment regarding this problem. It has a threefold aspect.(a) The acts of sacrifice, gifts, and austerities should not be relinquished; but should be performed...

(b) ...For sacrifices, gifts, and austerities are the means of purification for the wise.The practice of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned; it should certainly be undertaken. Sacrifice, charity, and austerity are indeed the purifiers of the wise.Acts of sacrifice, gift, and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be performed; for sacrifice, gift, and austerity are the purifiers of the wise.The actions of Vedic sacrifice, gift, and austerity should not be relinquished and they must necessarily be performed; for the men of wisdom, the Vedic sacrifice, gift, and austerity are the means of purification.Acts of sacrifice, benevolence, and austerity should not be given up, but should be performed, for they purify the aspiring soul.It is My decided and final view that even these acts should be done, O Arjuna, with relinquishment of attachment and the forsaking of the fruits thereof.But even these actions must be undertaken by renouncing attachment and hankering for results. This is My firm and definitive conclusion, O Partha.But even these actions should be performed, leaving aside attachment and the desire for rewards, O Arjuna; this is my certain and most assured conviction.Even these actions should be performed by relinquishing attachment and the fruits thereof; this is my considered best opinion, O son of Prtha!But they should be done with detachment and without thought of reward. This is my final judgement.But the renunciation of obligatory acts is not proper; abandonment of these through delusion is declared to be of a Tamasic nature.Abandoning one's daily obligatory acts is not justifiable; giving up those through delusion is said to be rooted in tamas.Verily, the renunciation of obligatory action is not proper; the abandonment of the same out of delusion is declared to be Tamasic.The renunciation of the enjoined action does not make sense; and completely relinquishing it, out of ignorance, is proclaimed on all sides as an act of Tamas (Strand).It is not right to give up actions which are obligatory; and if they are misunderstood, it is the result of sheer ignorance.He who renounces acts that are painful out of fear of bodily suffering performs a Rajasika abandonment; however, he does not gain the fruit of such abandonment.Whatever action one may relinquish merely as being painful, out of fear of physical suffering, he, having resorted to renunciation based on rajas, will surely not acquire the fruits of renunciation.He who abandons action out of fear of bodily trouble (because it is painful), does not obtain the merit of renunciation by performing such Rajasic renunciation.He who would, out of fear of bodily exertion, relinquish an action just because it is painful—that person, having thus made relinquishment an act of the Rajas (Strand), would not at all gain the fruit of that relinquishment.To avoid an action out of fear of physical suffering, as it is likely to be painful, is to act out of passion, and the benefit of renunciation will not be gained.When actions are performed as they ought to be done, O Arjuna, renouncing attachment and the results thereof, such abandonment is regarded as Sattvika.Whatever obligatory duty is performed just because it is a bounden duty, O Arjuna, by giving up attachment and the results as well—that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva.Whatever obligatory action is done, O Arjuna, merely because it ought to be done, abandoning attachment and also the desire for reward, that renunciation is regarded as sattvic (pure)."This is a thing to be performed" - just on that ground, whatever usual action is performed, relinquishing attachment and also fruit - that act of relinquishment is deemed to be of the Sattva (strand).He who performs an obligatory action, believing it to be a duty that ought to be done, without any personal desire to do the act or to receive any return—such renunciation is pure.One who has abandoned, imbued with Sattva, wise, and whose doubts have been dispelled—such a person neither hates disagreeable acts nor clings to agreeable ones.The man of renunciation, imbued with sattva, wise and free from doubts, does not hate unbecoming action, nor does he become attached to becoming activity.The man of renunciation, pervaded by purity, intelligent, and with his doubts cut asunder, does not hate an unpleasant task nor is he attached to a pleasant one.The man of renunciation, who is well-possessed of Sattva, is wise and has his doubts destroyed—he does not hate unskilled action and does not cling to skilled action.The wise man who has attained purity, whose doubts are resolved, who is filled with the spirit of self-abnegation, does not shy away from action due to its pain, nor does he crave it due to its pleasure.For, it is impossible for one who has a body to completely abandon actions. But he who gives up the results of his works is called the one who has abandoned them.Since it is not possible for one who holds onto a body to give up actions entirely, therefore he who renounces the results of his actions is called a man of renunciation.Indeed, it is not possible for an embodied being to completely abandon actions; however, he who relinquishes the rewards of actions is truly called a man of renunciation.Indeed, to relinquish actions entirely is not possible for a body-bearing one; but whoever relinquishes the fruits of actions, he is said to be a man of [true] relinquishment.But since those still in the body cannot entirely avoid action, in their case, the abandonment of the fruit of action is considered as complete renunciation.Undesirable, desirable, and mixed—thus, threefold is the fruit of work that accrues after death to those who have not renounced; but to those who have renounced, none accrues whatsoever.The threefold results of actions—the undesirable, the desirable, and the mixed—accrue after death to those who do not resort to renunciation, but never to those who resort to renunciation.The threefold fruit of action (evil, good, and mixed) accrues after death to those who do not abandon it, but never to those who do.The three-fold fruit of action—the undesired, the desired, and the mixed—accrues even after death to those who are not men of renunciation, but never to those who are men of renunciation.For those who cannot renounce all desires, the fruit of action hereafter is threefold—good, evil, and partly good and partly evil. But for him who has renounced, there is none.Learn from Me, O Arjuna, these five causes for the accomplishment of all acts, as described in Sankhya-krtanta—the science of exact understanding of things—for the accomplishment of works.O mighty-armed one, learn from Me these five factors for the accomplishment of all actions, which have been spoken of in the Vedanta, in which actions terminate.Learn from Me, O mighty-armed Arjuna, these five causes, as declared in the Sankhya system, for the accomplishment of all actions.O mighty-armed one! Learn from Me these five causes, declared in the conclusion of deliberations on proper knowledge, for the accomplishment of all actions.I will now tell you, O Mighty Man, the five causes that must come together, according to the final decision of philosophy, for an action to be accomplished.The seat of action, the agent, the various kinds of organs, the different and distinctive functions of vital air, and the fifth among these—Divinity—all these.The locus, the agent, the different kinds of organs, the many and varied activities, and the divine are the fifth here.The body, the doer, the various senses, the different functions of various kinds, and the presiding deity—the fifth.The basis, the agent, the various instruments, the distinct activities of various kinds, and Destiny, which is the fifth factor, are all present.They have a body, a personality, physical organs, and manifold activities and destinies.For whatever action a person undertakes with their body, speech, and mind, whether right or wrong, i.e., enjoined or forbidden by the Sastras, the following five are its causes:Whatever action a person performs with their body, speech, and mind, whether it be just or its opposite, these five are the causes of it.Whatever action a person performs with their body, speech, and mind, whether right or wrong, these five are its causes.O Arjuna! Whatever action is undertaken with the body, speech, or mind, whether it is lawful or otherwise, its factors are these five.Whatever action a person performs, whether by muscular effort, speech, or thought, and whether it be right or wrong, these five are the essential causes.Therefore, he who, due to his uncultivated understanding, perceives only the self as the agent, he of wicked mind does not truly perceive.Therefore, anyone whose intellect is imperfect and perceives the Absolute Self as the agent, does not perceive properly and has a distorted intellect.Now, such being the case, verily he who, owing to an untrained understanding, looks upon his Self, which is isolated, as the agent, he of perverted intelligence does not see.But this being the case, whoever views himself as the sole agent due to their imperfect intellect—they, the defective-minded ones, do not view things rightly.But the fool, who, due to his immature judgment, supposes that it is his own Self alone that acts, perverts the truth and does not see rightly.He who is free from the notion of 'I am the doer,' and whose understanding is not tainted, does not slay, even though he slays all these men, nor is he bound.He who has no feeling of egoism, whose intellect is untainted, he does not kill, nor does he become bound—even by killing these creatures!He who is free from the egoistic notion, whose intelligence is not tainted by good or evil, though he slays these people, he does not slay, nor is he bound by the action.He whose mental disposition is not dominated by the sense of 'I', and whose intellect is not stained—he, even if he slays these worlds, does not [really] slay any and is not fettered.He who has no pride and whose intellect is unalloyed by attachment, even though he kills these people, he does not kill them, and his act does not bind him.Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower are the threefold incitements to action. The instrument, the act, and the agent are the threefold constituents of action.Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower—these are the threefold inducements to action. The comprehension of actions comes under three heads: the instruments, the object, and the subject.Knowledge, the knowable, and the knower form the threefold impulse for action; the organ, the action, and the agent form the threefold basis of action.The instrument of knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knowing subject—the prompting in action, consisting of these threefold elements—is the proper grasping of action with threefold elements, namely, the instrument, the object, and the agent.Knowledge, the knower, and the object of knowledge are the three incentives to action; and the act, the actor, and the instrument are the threefold constituents.Knowledge, action, and agent are declared in the science of the Gunas to be of three kinds, according to the difference in the Gunas. Listen to them also as they are.Knowledge, action, and agent are stated in the teaching about the gunas to be only of three kinds, according to the differences of the gunas. Hear about them also as they are.Knowledge, action, and actor are declared in the science of the Gunas (Sankhya philosophy) to be of three kinds only, according to the distinction of the Gunas. Of these, hear duly.The instrument of knowledge, the object, and the agent are just three kinds due to the differences in the strands—thus it is declared in enumerating the strands. You must also listen to these [from Me] as they are.The knowledge, the action, and the doer differ according to their qualities. Listen to this as well.Know that knowledge to be sattvika, by which one sees in all beings an immutable existence, undivided even in the divided.Know that knowledge to originate from sattva, through which one sees a single, undecaying, undivided entity in all the diversified things.That by which one sees the indestructible Reality in all beings, not separate in any of them—know that knowledge to be Sattvic.That instrument of knowledge, by means of which one perceives the singular, immutable existence in all beings, the unclassified among the classified ones—that you must know to be born of the Sattva (Strand).That knowledge which sees the One Indestructible in all beings, the One Indivisible in all separate lives, can be truly called Pure Knowledge.But that knowledge which sees all beings, due to their individual nature, as distinct entities—know that knowledge to be Rajasic.But know that knowledge to originate from rajas, which amidst all things apprehends the different entities of various kinds as distinct [as possessing distinct selves].But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct kinds as being distinct from one another, know thou that knowledge to be Rajasic.That instrument of knowledge, by means of which one considers the varied natures of different sorts in all beings as truly distinct—that is regarded to be of the Rajas strand.The knowledge that perceives the manifold existence in all beings as separate comes from passion.But that knowledge is declared to be Tamasika which clings to one single act as if it were the whole, which is not based on reason, and which is false and insignificant.But that (knowledge) is said to be born of tamas which is confined to one form as if it were all, which is irrational, unconcerned with truth, and trivial.But that which clings to one single effect as if it were the whole, without reason, without any foundation in Truth, and is trivial—that is declared to be Tamasic.That [instrument-of-knowledge], because of which one, not realizing the whole, gets indulged without reason in a particular activity, and which is unconcerned with the real nature of things and is insignificant—that is declared to be of the Tamas (Strand).But that which clings blindly to one idea as if it were all, without logic, truth, or insight, has its origin in darkness.That obligatory act is said to be Sattvika, which is done without attachment, without desire or aversion, and by one who seeks no fruit.The daily obligatory action which is performed without attachment and without likes or dislikes, by one who does not hanker for rewards, is said to be born of sattva.An action that is ordained, free from attachment, done without love or hatred, and without desire for reward is declared to be Sattvic.The object that has been acquired with determination, without attachment and without desire or hatred, by one who does not crave to reap the fruit of their action - that is declared to be of the Sattva (Strand).An obligatory action done by one who is disinterested, who neither likes nor dislikes it, and gives no thought to the consequences that may follow, such an action is Pure.But that act is said to be Rajasic, which is performed with great effort by one who seeks to gratify their desires and under the prompting of egoism.But that action is said to be born of rajas which is done by one desirous of results or by one who is egotistical, and which is highly strenuous.But that action which is done by one longing for the fulfillment of desires or gain with egotism or with much effort is declared to be Rajasic (passionate).The object which is abundant in afflictions and which is further desired by one who craves to attain the desired thing with the feeling of 'I'—that is considered to be of the Rajas (Strand).But even though an action involves the most strenuous endeavor, yet if the doer is seeking to gratify their desires and is filled with personal vanity, it may be assumed to originate in passion.That act is said to be Tamasika which is undertaken through delusion, without regard to consequences, loss, injury, and one's own capacity.That action is said to be born of tamas which is undertaken out of delusion, without consideration of its consequences, loss, harm, and ability.That action which is undertaken from delusion, without regard for the consequences, loss, injury, and one's own ability, is declared to be Tamasic (dark).The object which is gained, due to ignorance, without considering the result, the loss, the injury to others, and one's own strength—that is declared to be of the Tamas (Strand).An action undertaken through delusion, with no regard to the spiritual implications, the capacity of the doer, or the potential harm that may follow, is assumed to be a product of ignorance.That agent is said to be Sattvika, who is free from attachment, who does not boast of himself, who is endowed with steadiness and zeal, and who is unaffected by success and failure.[Ast. introduces this verse with 'Idanim kartrbhedah ucyate, Now is being stated the distinctions among the agents.'-Tr.] The agent who is free from attachment [Attachment to results or the idea of agentship.], not egotistical, endowed with fortitude and diligence, and unperturbed by success and failure is said to be possessed of sattva.An agent who is free from attachment, non-egoistic, endowed with firmness and enthusiasm, and unaffected by success or failure, is considered to be of a Sattvic (pure) nature.The agent who is free from attachment, who does not make any speech of egoism, who is full of contentment and enthusiasm, and who does not change mentally in success or failure—that agent is said to be of the Sattva nature.But when a person has no sentiment or ego, when they possess courage and confidence, not caring whether they succeed or fail, then their action arises from purity.That doer is called Rajasika who is passionate, who seeks the fruits of his actions, who is greedy, harmful, and impure, and who is swayed by delight and grief.The agent who has attachment, who is desirous of the results of actions, covetous, cruel by nature, unclean, and subject to joy and sorrow, is declared to be possessed of rajas.Passionate, desiring to obtain the reward of their actions, greedy, cruel, impure, moved by joy and sorrow, such an agent is said to be Rajasic.The agent, who is a man of passion, who craves the fruit of his actions, and is avaricious; who is injurious by nature, impure, and is overpowered by joy and grief—that agent is proclaimed to be of the Rajas (Strand).In one who is impulsive, greedy, looking for reward, violent, impure, and torn between joy and sorrow, it may be assumed that Passion is predominant.That doer is said to be Tamasika who is unqualified, unrefined, obstinate, depraved, dishonest, indolent, despondent, and lethargic.The agent who is unsteady, naive, inflexible, deceitful, wicked, lazy, sullen, and procrastinating is said to be possessed of tamas.Unsteady, vulgar, inflexible, deceitful, malicious, lazy, despondent, and procrastinating—such an agent is called Tamasic.The agent who does not exert is vulgar, obstinate, and deceitful; they are a man of wickedness and are lazy, sorrowful, and procrastinating—such an agent is said to be of the Tamas strand.While he whose purpose is weak, who is low-minded, stubborn, dishonest, malicious, lazy, despondent, and procrastinating—he may be assumed to be in darkness.Hear now, O Arjuna, the threefold division of Buddhi (reason) and Dhrti (fortitude) according to the Gunas, to be fully and severally set forth.O Dhananjaya, listen to the classification of the intellect and fortitude, which is threefold according to the gunas, while it is being stated in detail and separately.Hear thou the threefold division of intellect and firmness, according to the Gunas, as I declare them fully and distinctly, O Arjuna.You must listen to Me as I expound the three-fold division of the intellect and content, both completely and individually, based on the Strands, O Dhananjaya!Reason and conviction are threefold, according to the quality that is dominant. I will explain them fully and separately, O Arjuna!That Buddhi, O Arjuna, which knows activity and renunciation, what should be done and what should not be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and release—that Buddhi is Sattvika.O Partha, that intellect is born of sattva which understands action and withdrawal, duty and what is not duty, the sources of fear and fearlessness, as well as bondage and freedom.The intellect which knows the path of work and renunciation, what should be done and what should not be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation—that intellect is Sattvic (pure), O Arjuna.The intellect which knows the activity and the cessation from activity, the proper and improper actions, the fear and non-fear, and the bondage and emancipation—that intellect is considered to be of the Sattva (Strand).That intellect which understands the creation and dissolution of life, what actions should be done and what not, which discriminates between fear and fearlessness, bondage and deliverance, is Pure.The Buddhi that gives an erroneous knowledge of Dharma and Adharma (its opposite) and also of what should be done and what should not be done, O Arjuna, is Rajasic.O Partha, that intellect is born of rajas with which one wrongly understands virtue and vice, as well as what ought to be done and ought not to be done.That by which one wrongly understands dharma and adharma, and also what ought to be done and what ought not to be done—that intellect, O Arjuna, is rajasic (passionate).The intellect, by means of which one decides incorrectly between the righteous and the unrighteous, and what is a proper action and an improper one—that intellect is of the Rajas, O son of Prtha!The intellect that does not understand what is right and wrong, and what should be done and not done, is under the sway of Passion.That Buddhi, O Arjuna, which, enveloped in darkness, regards Adharma as Dharma and reverses every value, is Tamasika.O Partha, that intellect is born of tamas which, being covered by darkness, considers vice as virtue, and indeed perceives all things contrary to what they are.That intellect, O Arjuna, which is enveloped in darkness and sees Adharma as Dharma and all things perverted, is Tamasic (dark).The intellect which, containing darkness (ignorance), conceives the unrighteous one as righteous and all things topsy-turvy—that intellect is deemed to be of the Tamas (Strand).And that which, shrouded in Ignorance, thinks wrong to be right, and sees everything perversely, O Arjuna, that intellect is ruled by Darkness.That fortitude, by which one maintains the unwavering activities of the mind and vital force, and these sense-organs, through yoga—that fortitude is of the nature of sattva.O Partha, the firmness that is unfailing through concentration, with which one restrains the functions of the mind, vital forces, and the organs—that firmness is born of sattva.The unwavering firmness, through which Yoga restrains the functions of the mind, life-force, and senses—that firmness, O Arjuna, is Sattvic (pure).The unfailing content, by which one restrains, through Yoga, the activities of the mind, the living breath, and the senses, is considered to be of the Sattva (strand).The conviction and steady concentration with which the mind, the energy, and the senses are controlled—O Arjuna!—are the result of purity.That dhṛti, O Arjuna, by which one, who is desirous of fruits, longs for them with intense attachment and holds fast to duty, desire, and wealth—that dhṛti is rajasika.But, O Partha, the steadfastness with which one holds on to righteousness, covetable things, and wealth, desiring their fruits as the occasion for each arises, that steadfastness is born of rajas.But that, O Arjuna, by which one holds fast to Dharma (duty), enjoyment of pleasures, and earning of wealth, on account of attachment and desire for reward—that firmness, O Arjuna, is Rajasic (passionate).O Arjuna! The contentment by which one restrains one's bounden duty, pleasure, and wealth, and consequently desires the fruits of action—that contentment is of the Rajas strand, O son of Prtha!The conviction that always holds fast to rituals, self-interest, and wealth for the sake of what they may bring forth comes from passion.That Dhrti, by which a foolish person does not give up sleep, fear, grief, depression, and passion, O Arjuna, is of the nature of Tamas.That firmness is considered to be born of tamas, due to which a person with a corrupt intellect does not give up sleep, fear, sorrow, despondency, as well as sensuality.That firmness, O Arjuna, by which a stupid man does not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair, and conceit, is Tamasic.The contentment where a foolish man does not give up his sleep, fear, grief, despondency, and arrogance—that contentment is deemed to be of the Tamas (Strand).And that which clings perversely to false idealism, fear, grief, despair, and vanity is the product of ignorance.Now hear from Me, O Arjuna, the threefold division of pleasure৷৷ that in which one rejoices through long practice and in which one comes to the end of pain.Now hear from Me, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, as regards the three kinds of joy: That in which one delights due to habit, and certainly attains the cessation of sorrows; [S. and S.S. take the second line of this verse along with the next verse referring to sattvika happiness.-Tr.]And now, O Arjuna, hear from Me of the threefold pleasure, in which one rejoices through practice and surely comes to the end of pain.O best among the Bharatas! Now, you must also listen to Me about the three-fold happiness, wherein one delights in practice and attains the end of suffering.Hear further the three kinds of pleasure. That which increases day by day delivers one from misery.That which, at first, is like a poison but becomes like an elixir in the end, born from the serene state of mind focused on the Self—such pleasure is said to be Sattvika.That which is like poison in the beginning, but is likened to nectar in the end, and which arises from the purity of one's intellect—that joy is spoken of as born of sattva.That which is like poison at first but in the end like nectar—that happiness is declared to be sattvic, born of the purity of one's own mind due to self-realization.[The happiness] which is like poison in the moment but is like nectar in the result—that happiness, born of serenity of the soul and intellect, you must know to be of the sattva (strand).Which at first seems like poison but afterwards acts like nectar—that pleasure is pure, for it is born of wisdom.That pleasure which arises from the contact of senses with their objects, which is like elixir at first but like poison in the end, is said to be Rajasic.That joy is referred to as born of rajas, which, arising from the contact of the organs and their objects, is like nectar in the beginning but like poison in the end.That happiness which arises from the contact of the senses with the objects, which is initially like nectar but eventually like poison, is said to be Rajasic.[The happiness] which is like nectar at its due time due to the contact between the senses and sense-objects; but which is like poison at the time of its result—that is considered to be of the Rajas (Strand).That which, at first, is like nectar, as the senses revel in their objects, but in the end acts like poison—that pleasure arises from Passion.That pleasure which, at the beginning and end, deludes the self, through sleep, sloth, and error, is declared to be tamasic.That joy is said to be born of tamas, which, both in the beginning and in the end, is delusive to oneself and arises from sleep, laziness, and inadvertence.That happiness which at first, as well as in the end, deludes the self, and which arises from sleep, indolence, and heedlessness—that is declared to be Tamasic.The happiness that, both initially and subsequently, is of the nature of deluding the Self; and which results from sleep, indolence, and heedlessness—that is stated to be of the Tamas (Strand).While the pleasure that drugs the senses from start to finish, which springs from indolence, lethargy, and folly—that pleasure flows from Ignorance.There is no creature, on earth or among the gods in heaven, that is exempt from these three Gunas born of Prakrti.There is no entity in the world, nor among the gods in heaven, that can be free from these three gunas born of Nature.There is no being on earth or in heaven among the gods that is liberated from the three qualities born of Nature.Whether on earth or among the gods in heaven, there is not a single being that is free from these three strands born of material nature.There is nothing anywhere on earth or in the higher worlds that is free from the three Qualities, for they are born of Nature.The duties of the Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras are clearly divided, O Arjuna, according to their Gunas, born of their nature.O scorcher of enemies, the duties of the Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras have been fully classified according to the gunas born from Nature.Of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras, O Arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the qualities born of their own nature.The duties of the Brahmanas, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, and the Shudras are properly classified according to the qualities that are the sources of their nature, O scorcher of foes!O Arjuna! The duties of spiritual teachers, the soldiers, the traders, and the servants have all been fixed according to the dominant quality in their nature.The control of the senses and mind, austerity, purity, forbearance, uprightness, knowledge, special knowledge, and faith—all these constitute the duty of a Brahmana, born of his inherent nature.The natural duties of the Brahmanas are the control of the internal and external organs, austerity, purity, forgiveness, straightforwardness, knowledge, as well as wisdom [Knowledge refers to the understanding of subjects presented by the scriptures; wisdom means making them matters of one's own experience.], and faith.Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness, and uprightness, as well as knowledge, realization, and belief in God, are the duties of Brahmanas, born of their own nature.Quietude, self-control, purity, forbearance, straightforwardness, knowledge, wisdom, and faith in another world are the duties of the Brahmanas, born of their nature.Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness, uprightness, knowledge, wisdom, and faith in God—these constitute the duty of a spiritual teacher.Valor, invincibility, steadiness, dexterity, and not fleeing in battle, generosity, and regality are the duties of a Kshatriya, born of his inherent nature.The natural duties of the Ksatriyas are heroism, boldness, fortitude, capability, and not retreating from battle, generosity, and lordliness.Prowess, splendor, firmness, dexterity, and not fleeing from battle, generosity, and lordliness are the duties of the Kshatriyas, born of their own nature.Heroic deeds, fiery energy, firmness, dexterity, and also non-attachment form the duties of the Ksatriyas, born of their nature, in battle, giving gifts, and overlordship.Valor, glory, firmness, skill, generosity, steadiness in battle, and the ability to rule—these constitute the duty of a soldier. They flow from his own nature.Agriculture, cattle-breeding, and trade are the duties of the Vaisya, born of their nature. And the duty of a Sudra is one of service, born of their nature.The natural duties of the Vaisyas are agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trading. The natural duty of the Sudras, too, is in the form of service.Agriculture, cattle-rearing, and trade are the duties of the Vaisya (merchant), born of their own nature; and service is the duty of the Sudra (servant-class), born of their own nature.Ploughing, tending to cattle, and trading are the actions of the Vaisyas, born of their nature. The action of service is of the Sudras, born of their nature.Agriculture, the protection of cows, and trade are the duties of a trader, in accordance with his nature. The duty of a servant is to serve, which also agrees with his nature.Devoting oneself to one's duty, one attains perfection. Hear now how one devoted to their own duty attains perfection.Being devoted to his own duty, one attains complete success. Hear how one devoted to their own duty achieves success.Each person devoted to their own duty attains perfection. How they attain perfection while being engaged in their own duty, hear now.A person, devoted to their own respective action, attains success. How one attains success through devotion to their own action, that you must hear from Me.Perfection is attained when one diligently attends to their duty. Listen, and I will tell you how it is attained by one who always minds their own duty.From whom all beings arise and by whom all this is pervaded—by worshipping Him with one's own duty, one reaches perfection.A human being achieves success by adoring, through his own duties, Him from whom is the origin of creatures and by whom all this is pervaded.He from whom all the beings have evolved and by whom all this is pervaded, worshipping Him with his own duty, one attains perfection.From whence the activities of the beings arise, and by which this universe is pervaded—worshipping That by one's own prescribed action, one attains success.One reaches perfection by dedicating their actions to God, Who is the source of all being and fills everything.Better is one's own duty, though ill done, than the duty of another, though well-performed. When one does the duty ordained by their own nature, they incur no stain.One's own duty, though defective, is superior to another's duty well performed. By performing a duty according to one's own nature, one does not incur sin.Better is one's own duty, even if it is destitute of merits, than the duty of another well performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no sin.Better is one's own prescribed duties, born of one's nature, even though it is devoid of excellence, than another's duty well executed; the doer of duty, dependent on one's own nature, does not incur sin.It is better to do one's own duty, however defective it may be, than to follow the duty of another, however well one may perform it. He who does his duty as his own nature reveals it, never commits a sin.One should not relinquish one's work, O Arjuna, though it may be imperfect; for, all endeavors are enveloped by imperfections as fire is by smoke.O son of Kunti, one should not give up the duty to which one is born, even though it be imperfect. For all undertakings are surrounded by evil, as fire is with smoke.One should not, O Arjuna, abandon the duty to which one is born, though it may be faulty; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil, just as fire is by smoke.O son of Kunti! One should not give up their nature-born duty, even if it appears to be defective. For, all beginnings are enveloped by harm, just as fire is by smoke.The duty that falls to one's lot of its own accord should not be abandoned, though it may have its defects. All acts are marred by defects, just as fire is obscured by smoke.He whose understanding is unattached on all sides, whose self is controlled, who is free from desires—he attains the supreme perfection transcending all activity through renunciation.He whose intellect remains unattached to everything, who has conquered his internal organs and is desireless, attains through monasticism the supreme perfection consisting of the state of one free from duties.He whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has subdued his self, from whom desire has fled, he attains the supreme state of freedom from action through renunciation.He, whose mind entertains no attachment to anything, who is self-controlled and is free from craving—he attains, by means of renunciation, the supreme success of actionlessness.He whose mind is entirely detached, who has conquered himself, and whose desires have vanished, reaches that stage of perfect freedom through his renunciation, where action completes itself and leaves no seed.Learn from me, O Arjuna, in brief how one who has attained perfection attains the Brahman—the supreme consummation of knowledge.Understand for certain from Me, in brief indeed, O son of Kunti, that process by which one who has achieved success attains Brahman, which is the supreme consummation of knowledge.Learn from Me, O Arjuna, in brief how one who has attained perfection reaches Brahman—the Eternal, that supreme state of knowledge.Having attained success, how one attains Brahman—an attainment which is confirmed to be the final beatitude of true knowledge—that you must learn from Me briefly.I will now state briefly how one who has reached perfection finds the Eternal Spirit, the state of Supreme Wisdom.Endowed with a purified understanding, subduing the mind with steadiness, relinquishing sound and other objects of the senses and casting aside love and hate;Endowed with a pure intellect and controlling oneself with fortitude, one should reject the objects beginning from sound [sound, touch, form, color, taste, and smell - Tr.] and eliminate attachment and hatred.Endowed with a pure intellect, controlling the self through firmness, relinquishing sound and other objects and abandoning attraction and hatred.He who has attained a completely pure intellect by firmly controlling his mind and renouncing sense-objects, sound, and driving out desire and hatred;Guided always by pure reason, bravely restraining himself, renouncing the objects of sense and giving up attachment and hatred; he attains peace.Resorting to solitude, eating sparingly, restraining speech, body, and mind, ever engaged in the yoga of meditation and taking refuge in dispassion;One who resorts to solitude, eats sparingly, has control over their speech, body, and mind, for whom meditation and concentration are ever the highest duty, and who is possessed of dispassion;Dwelling in solitude, eating sparingly, with speech, body, and mind subdued, always engaged in meditation and concentration, and resorting to dispassion.Who enjoys solitude, eats sparingly, has controlled their speech, body, and mind; who is devoted to the practice of meditation and yoga; and who has taken refuge in perpetual desirelessness;Enjoying solitude, being abstemious, having his body, mind, and speech under perfect control, and being absorbed in meditation, he becomes free—always filled with the spirit of renunciation.Forsaking egoism, power, pride, desire, wrath, and possessions, with no feeling of 'mine' and tranquil, he becomes worthy of the state of Brahman.Having discarded egotism, force, pride, desire, anger, and superfluous possessions, and being free from the idea of possession and serene, that person is fit for becoming Brahman.Having abandoned egoism, strength, arrogance, desire, anger, and covetousness, and being free from the notion of 'mine' and peaceful, he is fit for becoming Brahman.Relinquishing egotism, violence, pride, desire, wrath, and the sense of possession - he, the unselfish and calm one, is capable of becoming the Brahman.Having abandoned selfishness, power, arrogance, anger, and desire, possessing nothing of his own, and having attained peace, he is fit to join the Eternal Spirit.Having realized the state of Brahman, tranquil, he neither grieves nor craves. Regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to Me.One who has become Brahman and has attained the blissful Self does not grieve nor desire. Becoming the same towards all beings, he attains supreme devotion to Me.Becoming Brahman, serene in the Self, he neither grieves nor desires; he is the same to all beings, and obtains supreme devotion to Me.Having become the Brahman, the serene-minded one neither grieves nor rejoices; remaining equal to all beings, he gains the highest devotion to Me.When he unites with the Eternal and his soul knows the bliss of the Self, he feels no desire or regret, he regards all beings equally, and enjoys the blessing of supreme devotion to Me.Through devotion, he comes to know Me fully—who and what I am in reality, who I am and how I am. Knowing Me thus in truth, he forthwith enters into Me.Through devotion, he knows Me in reality, as to what and who I am. Then, having known Me truly, he enters into Me immediately afterward.By devotion, he knows Me in truth, who and what I am; then, having known Me in truth, he immediately enters into the Supreme.Through devotion he comes to know of Me: Who I am and how, in fact, I am—having correctly known Me, he enters into Me. Then afterwards,By such devotion, he sees Me, who I am and what I am; and thus realizing the truth, he enters into My kingdom.Taking refuge in Me and performing all works constantly, one, by My grace, attains the eternal and immutable abode.Ever engaging in all actions, one to whom I am the refuge, attains the eternal, immutable state through my grace.Having taken refuge in Me and doing all actions, by My grace he obtains the eternal, indestructible state of being.Performing all his actions all the time and taking refuge in Me, he attains, through My grace, the eternal, changeless state.Relying on Me in all his actions and doing them for My sake, he attains, by My grace, eternal and unchangeable life.Surrender all your actions to Me with your mind, keep Me as your goal, and practice Buddhi-yoga, focusing your thoughts on Me always.Mentally surrendering all actions to Me and accepting Me as the supreme, keep your mind ever fixed on Me by resorting to the concentration of your intellect.Mentally renouncing all actions in Me, having Me as the highest goal, and resorting to the yoga of discrimination, do thou ever fix thy mind on Me.Hence, O descendant of Bharata, renounce all actions in Me by your mind and take hold of the knowledge-Yoga. Always keep your thought-organ directed towards Me.Surrender your actions to Me, live in Me, focus your intellect on Me, and always think of Me.Focusing your thoughts on Me, you shall, by My grace, cross over all difficulties. If, however, out of self-conceit, you do not heed Me, you will perish.Having your mind fixed on Me, you will cross over all difficulties by My grace. If, however, you do not listen out of egotism, you will be destroyed.Fixing your mind on Me, you shall, by My grace, overcome all obstacles; but if you will not hear Me due to egoism, you shall perish.Having your thought-organ turned towards Me, you shall pass over all obstacles by My Grace. On the other hand, if you don't give up your sense of ego, you will not liberate yourself; instead, you will perish.Fix your mind on Me, and by My grace you will overcome the obstacles in your path. But if, misled by pride, you do not listen, then you will indeed be lost.If, in your self-conceit, you think, 'I will not fight,' your resolve is futile. Nature will compel you.Though you think 'I shall not fight', relying on egotism, this determination of yours is vain. Your nature will impel you!If, filled with egoism, thou thinkest, "I will not fight," then thy resolve is vain; nature will compel thee.In case, holding fast to the sense of ego, you think, 'I shall not fight,' that resolve of yours will be useless. Your own natural condition will incite you to fight.If you in your vanity think of avoiding this fight, your will shall not be fulfilled, for Nature herself will compel you.O Arjuna, bound by your own duty born out of your own inner disposition, and having no control over your own will, you will be compelled to do that very thing which you now do not desire to do through delusion.Being bound by your own duty, born of nature, O son of Kunti, you will, being helpless, verily do that which you do not wish to do, owing to indiscretion.O Arjuna, bound by your own Karma (action) born of your own nature, that which from delusion you wish not to do, even that you shall do helplessly.O son of Kunti! Being firmly bound by your own duty, born of your own nature, and thus not being independent, you would perform what you do not wish to do, due to your delusion.O Arjuna! Your duty binds you. It has arisen from your own nature, and that which you do not desire to do in your delusion, you will do that very thing. You are helpless.The Lord, O Arjuna, abides in the heart of every being, spinning them round and round, as if mounted on a wheel, by His power.O Arjuna, the Lord resides in the region of the hearts of all creatures, revolving through Maya all the creatures as though mounted on a machine!The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings, by His illusory power, to revolve as if mounted on a machine.O Arjuna! This Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, causing, by His trick of illusion, all beings to whirl round as if they are mounted on a revolving mechanical contrivance.God dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna! He causes them to revolve, as it were, on a wheel, by His mystic power.Seek refuge in Him alone, O Arjuna, with the entirety of your being. By His grace, you shall find supreme peace and an eternal abode.Take refuge in Him alone with your whole being, O scion of the Bharata dynasty. Through His grace, you will attain supreme peace and the eternal abode.Fly to Him for refuge with all your being, O Arjuna; by His grace you will obtain supreme peace and the eternal abode.To Him alone, O descendant of Bharata, you must go for refuge with all your thoughts. Through My grace, you will attain success and the eternal abode.With all your strength, fly to Him and surrender yourself, and by His grace you will attain Supreme Peace and reach the Eternal Home.Thus, the knowledge, the mystery of mysteries, has been declared to you by Me. Reflecting on it fully, do as you will.To you I have imparted this knowledge, which is more secret than any secret. Ponder over this as a whole and do as you like.Thus, wisdom more secret than secrecy itself has been declared to you by me. Reflect on it fully, then act as you wish.Thus, the path of wisdom, a better secret than all other secrets, has been expounded to you by Me; comprehend it fully and then act as you wish.Thus, I have revealed to you the truth, the mystery of mysteries. Having thought it over, you are free to act as you wish.Hear again My supreme word, the most secret of all; as I am exceedingly fond of you, I am telling you what is good for you.Listen again to My highest utterance, which is the most profound of all. Since you are ever dear to Me, I shall speak what is beneficial to you.Hear again My supreme word, most secret of all; for you are dearly beloved of Me, I will tell you what is good.Yet again, you must listen to My ultimate, supreme message—the highest secret of all. You are My dear one and have a firm intellect, so I shall tell you what is good for you.Listen to My last word once more, the deepest secret of all; you are My beloved, you are My friend, and I speak for your welfare.Focus your mind on Me. Be My devotee. Worship Me. Prostrate before Me. You will come to Me alone. I promise you truly; for you are dear to Me.Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer sacrifices to Me, and bow down to Me. Thus, you will come to Me alone. I promise you this truth, for you are dear to Me.Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. You will come to Me; I truly promise you this, for you are dear to Me.Fix your mind on Me; be devoted to Me; offer oblations to Me and bow down to Me; you will come to Me alone. I promise you this truly, for you are dear to Me.Dedicate yourself to Me, worship Me, sacrifice all for Me, prostrate yourself before Me, and you will surely come to Me. I truly pledge to you; you are My beloved.Relinquishing all Dharmas completely, seek Me alone for refuge. I will release you from all sins; grieve not.Abandon all forms of rites and duties, and take refuge in Me alone. I will free you from all sins; do not grieve.Abandon all duties and take refuge in Me alone; I will liberate you from all sins; do not grieve.Abandon all attributes and come to Me as your only refuge; I will rescue you from all sins; do not be sorrowful.Give up your earthly duties, surrender yourself to Me alone. Do not be anxious; I will absolve you from all your sins.Never should this be told by you to one who is not austere, who is not a devotee, nor to one who has no desire to listen, nor certainly to him who speaks ill of Me.This (that I have taught) should never be taught to one who is devoid of austerities, one who is not a devotee, one who does not render service, or one who cavils at Me.Never speak this to one who is devoid of austerities or devotion, who does not render service, who does not desire to listen, or who cavils at Me.This knowledge is for you, and it should never be imparted to one who does not observe austerities; to one who has no devotion; to one who has no desire to listen; and to one who is indignant towards Me.Do not speak this to one who has not practiced austerities, or to one who does not love, or who will not listen, or who mocks.He who proclaims this supreme mystery among My devotees shall come to Me, acquiring supreme devotion towards Me. There is no doubt about this.He who, entertaining supreme devotion to Me, speaks of this highest secret to My devotees, will without doubt reach Me alone.He who, with supreme devotion to Me, teaches this supreme secret to My devotees, shall undoubtedly come to Me.Whoever declares this highest secret to My devotees, cultivating an utmost devotion towards Me and not entertaining any doubt, shall reach Me.But he who teaches this great secret to My devotees, his is the highest devotion, and he shall surely come to Me.There is no one among men who does dearer service to Me than him. Nor shall there be anyone on earth dearer to Me than him.And compared to him, no other human is better at accomplishing what is dear to Me. Furthermore, there will be no one else in the world dearer to Me than him.There is no one among men who does service dearer to Me, nor shall there be anyone on earth dearer to Me than him.And, except for him, there would be no one among men who is the best performer of what is dear to Me; and there shall be no one else dearer to Me on earth.There is no one among men who can perform a service dearer to Me than this, nor is there any man on earth more beloved by Me than him.And he who will study our dialogue, which is consistent with Dharma, by him I shall be worshipped through the sacrifice of knowledge; that is My view.And he who will study this sacred conversation between us two, which is conducive to virtue, by him I shall be adored through the Sacrifice of Knowledge. This is My judgment.And he who studies this sacred dialogue of ours, by him I shall have been worshipped through the sacrifice of wisdom; such is my conviction.Whoever would learn this sacred dialogue of both of us, by them I am delighted through the knowledge-sacrifice: This is my opinion.He who will study this spiritual discourse of ours, I assure you, they shall thereby worship Me at the altar of Wisdom.And the man who listens to it with faith and without cavil, he too shall be released and shall reach the auspicious realms of those who have performed virtuous deeds.Any man who, being reverent and free from caviling, listens to this (teaching) with reverence, he too, becoming free, shall attain the blessed worlds of those who perform virtuous deeds.Also, the man who hears this, full of faith and free from malice, shall attain to the happy worlds of those of righteous deeds, and be liberated.A man who would at least hear this with faith and without indignation—he too, freed from sins, will attain the auspicious worlds of those who have performed meritorious acts.Yes, he who listens to it with faith and without doubt, even he, freed from evil, will rise to the worlds which the virtuous attain through righteous deeds.Have you heard this, O Arjuna, with a single-minded focus? Has your delusion, caused by ignorance, been dispelled?O Partha, have you listened to this with a one-pointed mind? O Dhananjaya, has your delusion caused by ignorance been dispelled?Has this been heard, O Arjuna, with one-pointed focus? Has the delusion of your ignorance been destroyed, O Dhananjaya?O son of Prtha! Have you heard this with an attentive mind? O Dhananjaya! Has your strong delusion, born of ignorance, been completely destroyed?O Arjuna, have you listened attentively to My words? Has your ignorance and delusion gone?Arjuna said, "My delusion has been destroyed, and, by Your grace, O Krsna, I have gained knowledge (Smrti). Freed from doubts, I stand steadfast, and I will fulfill Your will."Arjuna said, "O Acyuta, my delusion has been destroyed and my memory has been regained through Your grace. I stand with my doubt removed; I shall follow Your instructions."Arjuna said, "My delusion has been destroyed, for I have gained my knowledge (memory) through Your grace, O Krishna. I am now free from doubts. I will act according to Your word."Arjuna said, "My delusion is destroyed; I have regained my recollection through your grace, O Acyuta! I stand firm, free of doubts; I shall execute your command."Arjuna replied: "My Lord! O Immutable One! My delusion has fled. By Your Grace, O Changeless One, the light has dawned. My doubts have been dispelled, and I stand before You ready to do Your will."Sanjaya said, Thus I have heard this wondrous dialogue between Vasudeva and the great-minded Arjuna, which makes my hair stand on end.Sanjaya said, "I thus heard this conversation between Vasudeva and the great-souled Partha, which is unique and makes one's hair stand on end."Sanjaya said, Thus, I have heard this wonderful dialogue between Krishna and the high-souled Arjuna, which causes one's hair to stand on end.Sanjaya said: Thus, I have heard this wonderful and thrilling dialogue between Vasudeva and the mighty-minded son of Prtha.Sanjaya said: "I heard this rare, wonderful, and soul-stirring discourse between Lord Shri Krishna and the great-souled Arjuna.By the grace of Vyasa, I have heard this supreme mystery of Yoga, declared in person by Krsna, the Lord of Yoga.Through the favor of Vyasa, I heard this secret concerning the supreme Yoga from Krishna, the Lord of Yogas, while He Himself was speaking!Through the grace of Vyasa, I have heard this supreme and most secret Yoga, directly from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, Himself declaring it.Through the grace of Vyasa, I have heard this highly secret supreme Yoga from Krsna, the Lord of Yogis, while He was imparting it personally.Through the blessing of the sage Vyasa, I heard this secret and noble science from the lips of its Master, Lord Shri Krishna.O King, remembering again and again this wondrous and auspicious dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, I rejoice time and again.And, O King, while repeatedly remembering this unique, sacred dialogue between Kesava and Arjuna, I rejoice every moment.O King, remembering this wonderful and holy dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, I continually rejoice.O King! By repeatedly recollecting this wonderful, pious dialogue between Kesava and Arjuna, I am filled with delight again and again.O King! The more I think of that marvelous and holy discourse, the more I lose myself in joy.And, remembering over and over again that most marvelous form of Hari, great is my amazement, O King, and I rejoice again and again.O King, repeatedly recollecting that greatly extraordinary form of Hari, I am struck with wonder and rejoice again and again.And, remembering again and again that most wonderful form of Hari, I am filled with great wonder, O King; and I rejoice again and again.O great king! On recalling in my mind that extremely wonderful, supreme form of Hari, I am amazed and experience joy again and again.As I recall again and again the exceeding beauty of the Lord, I am filled with amazement and joy.Wherever there is Sri Krsna, the Lord of Yoga, and Arjuna the archer, there is always fortune, victory, wealth, and sound morality. This is my firm conviction.Where there is Krishna, the Lord of yogas, and where there is Partha, the wielder of the bow, there is fortune, victory, prosperity, and unfailing prudence. Such is my conviction.Wherever Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, is; and wherever Arjuna, the wielder of the bow, is; there is prosperity, victory, happiness, and a firm policy; this is my conviction.Where Krishna, the Lord of Yogis, remains, where the son of Prtha holds his bow, there lies fortune, victory, prosperity, and firm justice—so I believe.Wherever Lord Shri Krishna, the Prince of Wisdom, and Arjuna, the Great Archer, are, I am certain that good fortune, victory, happiness, and righteousness will follow.
